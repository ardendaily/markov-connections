I enjoyed the show you put on. Do you frequent this location? You were cruising pretty hard today. If you think this is you hmu.    


Young Guy at Steam - m4m

To the young dark haired guy at Steam this evening.  I enjoyed our encounter in the sauna and would be interested in meeting again there or somewhere else.  Let me know what I wouldn't let you do in the sauna and what happened after the sauna.  Looking forward to hearing from you.    


POF OKCUPID - m4w

You probably won't notice I deleted my profiles, it's okay. Would really liked to have at least met for a date. Realized trying to find a "relationship" on those sites was pretty futile. 


Sexy girl at Rite-Aid - m4w

You passed on my way out of rite-aid on divison and Cesar Chavez . You were a sexy little thing with dark hair, black sweat pants.... and a sexy smile...... I waited to say hello when you came out but you were too fast..... you did look back when you got to your car, I waited by my truck to see if you would stop but you left..... hit me up , I would love to chat ;)    


Karri c.  You disappeared - m4w

Miss our talks. You disappeared and I'm worried about you. 


Chloe Denver to pdx flight September - m4w

In September we sat next to each other on a flght from Denver to Portland and we bs'd most of the flight. You told me you hadn't flown in seven years because a person had a medical emergency on your last flight and it scared you. Then I had one. I don't remember much after that except that you were super kind to me. You were a pleasure to talk to and I'd like to see you again so I can thank you in person.    


jiffy lube tech.we talked about your fav restaurant. - m4m

I don't ever do this. But I was attracted to you. You are from the south. We talked about your fav restaurant. Im older if your into older guys. Would like to maybe get together. What's your fav place to eat.    


retired wolf - m4w

I would love to be in an elevator with you but I've heard about your group endeavors that shatter my heart... I still know where you come from but I can't accept a gift from such an act.. my passion burns slow with you and my day to day knowledge grows without you. We both are pegan from the garden of eaden. I slithered to your door step to find myself sobbing in the wake of the actions of my family.    


sweet smile near 21st and Powell - m4w

It was an unpopulated area, almost like an end of the block kind of place. I think it was because our paths almost collided that you smiled at me, and I smiled back. No one else was around, and that made me feel there's hope in the world. Maybe a dream... so much of our effort to appear normal can take so much out of us, whatever gender we are. We can be brave and still not know what to do with our frustration. What's the right thing to say or do. But maybe things are changing fast enough to make a difference.

You Bought Me A Forty - m4w

I had sores on my mouth and wore one holey shoe with no sock and my other foot bare, my toenails a yellow-burnt-orange. I hadn't seen a shower in weeks when you passed me near 4th and Stark. You might remember I was using a dirty pair of underwear to blow my nose. Don't worry, though, they weren't my own.

hearing your voice

it is hard to hear your voice for me.  That is why if I see it is you, I do not answer. I actually have my phone set up now so that any call or text that comes in automatically goes to my spam folder if the number isn't in my contacts.  I don't know who sent the picture.  I didn't recognize the number.  I just opened my spam folder and there was the picture of the car in the driveway.  I don't give out my number so I thought it was you, or someone who know's you or has access to your phone.  


Shelby from Portland - m4w

I'm looking for my friend Shelby, she is amazing and super cool. I wish we could connect again, I lost your phone number once again after we hung out last time. I wish we could have had longer together and I regret not spending more time with you . It sucked to have to watch you take the bus home after waiting for you for so long that day . Anyways I really miss talking to you and I hope you get this.  My blonde Shelby that got out of rehab. I miss the heck out of you.

If something is missing with the new one, let her go. Don't waste her time while you wait to rekindle with the old one.    


Who is bored? - m4w

Just curious if anyone's free today and would enjoy making a new friend.  Good conversation, and if we hit it off maybe some food and drinks.  Simple as that.


I miss my heart - m4w

I missed the opportunity to make you my wife official like, but I'll always see you as such in my heart. Over six years of missed connections that I regret. My dream is coming true, something will be missing with the new one. I would love to re-kindle when the growing is done because our connection misses nothing.

Asked You To Come In The Hot Tub at The Velvet Rope - w4m

You were gorgeous and tall.  I was in the hot tub at the velvet rope a few weeks ago.  We made eye contact and I immediately wanted you so bad.  Invited you into the hot tub and started flirting with you as soon as you entered.  The guy I was with got jealous, freaked out and threatened to leave so I had to split.  If you see this add, please hit me up!  I'd love joining you at the velvet rope or anywhere in the future!

PSU by community rec field today - m4w

I was with a pal walking behind you and you suddenly stopped and looked back and smile. I smiled back at you, but I kept walking. After 10 minutes, I decided to go back and look for you to ask for your name and number, but I couldn't find you. This happened around 1:30pm. If you remember email me back and tell me what color was my shirt so I know you are the one.. I just wanted to tell you how beautiful you are...Hope you don't have a bf...

Bed Bath and Beyond - m4w

Beautiful eyes. You and me. Remember? I can't help but think we are supposed to meet again. I keep seeing your eyes in my dreams. You must be Italian. You weren't wearing a ring. We stared at each other. You're the most intriguing, interesting, and beautiful woman I've met in Portland. I was so distracted by your beauty that I forgot to introduce myself. You had me smitten. Were you as curious? Your name rhymes with Patty :)

I saw you on Trimet 43 to Washington Square - m4w

I know this is a long shot, but I was riding the 43 today to Washington Square and at about 12:35 you got on the bus. You had short brown hair with a skeleton hand hair clip in your hair. you were wearing a red Peacoat, pink leggings, a purple skirt, and black felt boots. You had dangling earrings and no ring on either hand. You sat in the handicapped seating area. I was the guy in the Orange Beavers shirt and the blue backpack. You were very cute and I'm very shy. I know I should have said something, but I didn't.

Him: hunter-camo top,black hat and a total douche. A real man doesnt act like that,especially in a public place. Me: mid 40s in a blue sweater that said Brecenridge Colorado on it,wondering how the stupid guys get the awesome girls. If you answer put my hair color in the header...it was pretty obvious. I hope you drop that fool like a bad habit!

Last Shot... - m4w

Here it is and I'm another day sadder. Trying to reach out to you through the only option left to me. You'll read this, roll your eyes, and go on with your life. For me, this is the last time I can do this. Missing you so much. Looking at the pics you post. It hurts to know I meant nothing to you. I know I hurt you. It was not intentional, it was an instant reaction. I should have just talked to you. I want you to know what you and your daughter mean to me. It broke my heart when I had to tell her I couldn't talk to her anymore. You may think my love is misguided or misplaced or in some other way not real. I can assure you it very much is. I know I was never what you wanted no matter how you stated otherwise. I know I suck at communication but it's something I work on. I am damaged goods for sure, but I looked to you as inspiration. Even though you won't believe me, I fell in love with you Breana. I hope this reaches you and beg your forgiveness so that one day you'll reach out to me. But I know that won't happen. You've already moved on.

But I know you are a tough dude.Strong with a great personality and amazing body, and a super huge tool and huge balls hanging between your legs.  Your girlfriend must feel as the most luckiest girl in town. Sorry for this add but I have always wanted to say something to you but I know you are straight.

Am I done my love - w4m

Loving you has been the most hellasious year of my life. One minute you love me like you never want to lose me and the next you are hurtful and push me away. You tell me I am the best girlfriend you have ever had, yet you intentionally say and do things to hurt me. I have walked through the depths of hell this past year and I have tried recently to justify staying because I love you so damn much. But loving you is breaking my heart. I feel like I give and give until emotionally I have nothing left. I try to show you how much you mean to me by going out of my way to make sure you have your needs met, even if it is something small to let you know you are on my mind.  Losing sleep and sacrificing my life outside of you just to have a few extra moments with you. Instead of feeling like you appreciate my effort I feel as though it never seems good enough to you. Why can't you see the value in this effort and show the same for me? Instead of building me up with showing me that I am the woman you want and complimenting me, you break me down by making me cry and take blow after blow to my confidence. It's pretty crumby that I have complete strangers compliment me more than my boyfriend does. Then I think about how different our goals are in life. The future I want is one you don't, even though if things would have stayed on route our future would be amazing and what I thought was what we both wanted. But now I just feel wrong in thinking that you ever wanted it. Like you lied to me. But I don't understand why. And tonight I realized something major, I am struggling with trusting you. I just feel it in the pit of my stomach that something isn't right. I fear that you have once again strayed and are finding happiness with another. I know you will deny this and be exhausted with trying to ease my insecurity and become frustrated and want to give up, but I wish you could understand how I need you to help rebuild my trust in you and keep trying to ease the broken trust in our relationship. If our relationship was worth it to you you would fight for it without a doubt in your mind if it was worth your effort and frustration. Because honestly you are the reason that trust was broken to begin with and you have given me reasons to doubt you. Now with all of the negative on the table, I know you are asking why I have stayed. That is simple to answer, because I love you so deeply in my soul that even the thought of you not by my side takes my breath away. I think of you every day of my life. I dream of you, of us, of how things should have been and I want so badly to have the future we planned. You told me I was your queen and you are the king, this made my heart flutter in pure joy and made me love you even more. I have never felt this depth of connection with anyone before. I genuinely care how you are, what you are doing, how your day is going, what you are feeling. I'm not on autopilot in caring about you, I truly care like you are a part of me. I just wish I knew whether to keep trying or walk away. Is it worth it? Will you ever love me and treat me the way I need? Will I ever make you happy enough to know in my heart of hearts that you will not stray? Can we save us, or am I the only one trying to keep us together? Can we build a future together that will make us both happy? Or will I have to sacrifice everything I desire to keep you in my life?  I wish you could embrace us and love me whole heartedly like I do you.

Because honestly you are the reason that trust was broken to begin with and you have given me reasons to doubt you. Now with all of the negative on the table, I know you are asking why I have stayed. That is simple to answer, because I love you so deeply in my soul that even the thought of you not by my side takes my breath away. I think of you every day of my life. I dream of you, of us, of how things should have been and I want so badly to have the future we planned. You told me I was your queen and you are the king, this made my heart flutter in pure joy and made me love you even more. I have never felt this depth of connection with anyone before. I genuinely care how you are, what you are doing, how your day is going, what you are feeling. I'm not on autopilot in caring about you, I truly care like you are a part of me. I just wish I knew whether to keep trying or walk away. Is it worth it? Will you ever love me and treat me the way I need? Will I ever make you happy enough to know in my heart of hearts that you will not stray? Can we save us, or am I the only one trying to keep us together? Can we build a future together that will make us both happy? Or will I have to sacrifice everything I desire to keep you in my life?  I wish you could embrace us and love me whole heartedly like I do you.

St Johns Tanned Dready Gal on Bike - m4w

We crossed paths outside of Safeway And across the St from McMenamins in St Johns. You had darker colored skin, and dark hair - on your bike with a helmet on.  I was walking my dog, and she was really interested in you :)  I thought you were really pretty, and I bet we would have a lot in common. Not really expecting anything to come out of this, but it kind of felt like we had a moment did we not?  Anyways, hope you have a good night :)

Hi, two leafs.... 


Long looks at Fantasy - m4m

The first time I saw you, I found you attractive, but I try to avoid becoming too interested in anyone I meet at Fantasy. It's probably just your friendly smile and charming personality that continue to catch my eye, but this afternoon when I stopped in (the second time), I couldn't take my eyes off you--and you seemed to hold my gaze. Was it my imagination? Or do you have some curiosity or potential attraction to me, as an older man?    


looking for a woman  that I use to hookup with. In Woodstock area - m4w

Hi so I am looking for a  woman that I use to hookup with.  It was over 3 years ago.    I use to come over at night.  You said you liked cuddling in my arms.

PSU library - filling water bottle! - m4w

You were taking soooo long filling your water bottle and you told me how water keeps your brain from drying out and shriveling up. I sat down right away and tried to draw a picture of this process but maybe you could still help me fill in all the details? You're probably a scientist. Me, I'm a hindsight flirtation coach.    


You: hip-hop teacher. Me: "a thinker" - m4m

Tall light skinned beauty - w4m

I've only seen you a few times over the past few months. Twice at mill plain and once at hazel dell planet fitness. I first saw you at the mill plain location. You gave your tanning goggles to a girl who had forgot hers. I also saw you at the hazel dell location around 11am a couple months ago. You were ahead of me while I was running on the tread mill with a girlfriend. You kept looking back at me. This last time I saw you at mill plain last week around 4pm. I was with a male friend and we were both lifting weights. I should've asked for your number but I don't have enough guts even though I know we were watching each other.

Shy, quiet, stressed, anxious milf. - m4w

I saw you while I was out and about. You were a bit older, past the dating and bar age but still very much a woman. You looked... stressed? Maybe a bit anxious? Or maybe I was reading it wrong and you were just shy. Either way I wanted to approach you and talk to you. I'm not sure if you were married, I didn't see the ring finger, but I'm not too sure it matters very much. If you're the woman I saw, a bit older, rushing about town, maybe harried or stressed, and need some relaxation from a younger attractive, muscular gentleman, let me know. :)

Gal in white car (Kaiser Permenente) - m4w

I was having a downright rotten day and you drove by me and smiled, waved, and there was something frenetic in it, and it cheered me up. On top of it, you were cute, and had an I <3 Oregon sticker on your car. I have the same logo tattooed on my leg.


looking back - m4w

As we passed each other we locked eyes then we both kept looking back to see if one another was looking. We ran into each other again and I asked you how you were doing as you were going down the escalator as you got to the bottom you looked back again. I was hoping to run into you a third time but I wasn't lucky enough. you'll probably never see this post but if you do and are interested tell me what I was wearing so I know it's you.

Coworker initials KJ - m4w

There is just something about you that I can't get over. You have an absolutely amazing body,  and I'm always thinking about it. I know,  it's terrible that I keep thinking these thoughts.  I'm a married man,  and it's not acceptable....but my god, I just want to touch you. I'm afraid to even flirt mildly, because I'm afraid you'll see right through me if I do. Sigh. I know nothing will ever come from this.  But I have to put it out there every once in awhile...

A Whole New Level Of Hate - w4m

That's what you told me Stephen when we were going thur a divorce and I NEVER did, even after everything you and your whore put me thur...( like her texting me a pic of you and her in bed together) AND after you two have big BLOW OUT, you wanted me back! I gave US a second chance because I still loved you with every fiber of my being and then I find out months later that you are still involved with her... ALL I WANT IS A APOLOGY. I gave you 2 outs that if you don't fill the same way about me, we should just part as friends and you told me that you still wanted me but that I needed to wait for you to the man I have waited for 15 years...your a man right, even kids have to apology's when they have done something wrong! and after 6 months I need to let go of THIS HATE, that I have never had before in  my LIFE and if you can't give that to me then I will pour out my heart of EVERYTHING that has happen in last 3 years and I know for you I am asking a lot but after all we have been thur I don't think I am asking much (remember 1994 when we first meet)

PDX to Mexico last month - w4m

We sat in the same row on a red eye flight last month 9/10 to Mexico. My daughter didn't share her oreos. There was a "medical situation" on the plane we tag teamed on. You took that on like a boss, just wanted to say I thought you were amazing, devastatingly handsome and so kind. Disappointed I didn't even get your name. You got off at guadalajara. Would love to have coffee sometime and ty.    


Bartender at Famous Dave's Tualatin - m4m

You were the bartender at Famous Dave's in tualatin around 7pm tonight (Monday). You were very nice and caught my attention while you waited on us but couldn't really tell which team you played for. I was with a friend, and ended up leaving, then coming back to the bar after I left because I had forgotten my credit card when I closed out. We joked about how the "real" reason I came back was because I had also forgotten my leftovers. Maybe we can grab a drink sometime when you're not behind the bar? Tell me what beer I drank or what food I ordered so I know it's you. Unless you're straight, in which case I apologize for the misunderstanding :)    


Ashley-I printed your daughters homework - w4w

$2 worth of books sold to me at your yard sale - m4w

Funny story which happened on 10/08 at little after 3pm. I was at the store getting grocerys when I was prompted for cash back at checkout. Thinking for a moment I decided to get $2 so I could get a cup of coffee at my local coffee shop ($5 minimum purchase to use a debit card). So then I'm walking home down SE 37th like I do every day and I come to SE Harrison and your house with the small yard sale is opposite to me. Walking across the street I noticed you and your two pals. All three of you are cute but it was you that got me to stop. I saw your smile. So I stepped up on your lawn to paruse the books. Glancing over I saw you sitting with your friend giggling. Taking two books that genuinely interested me, you walked over with your adorable smile and glasses and took my money.


Baja fresh for lunch - m4w

Not sure if it was just me but I felt we were both checking each other out. I found you very attractive and would like to talk to you. I was with a group of friends so I couldn't really say hi. You probably won't see this but if you do let's talk. Tell me how many friends I was with so I know it's you.    


I fell in love in the fall - w4m

I've never felt a fraction of the emotion I've felt with you. No one has ever made the earth turn under my feet. When you give me those big Brown doe eyes I get weak. I crossed so many things off of my bucket list with you and then I self destructed not knowing how to fix the obvious depression you were sinking into. You are really the person who showed me the ropes around here. You dumped me and you had every right. I was a mess and really that's the only reason I'm trying to get back on top now. At least you were kind enough to wait until my friends moved up here. We went out on Tuesday to talk about things at our usual place on alberta and I told you I was happy being friends but really all I can think about is how things used to be.

You pulled into the apartments and I felt I couldn't follow without more of a sign from you. You were beautiful!!!    


Shopping for more? - m4w

At winco around noon. We both kept going down the isles the opposite way from each other, exchanging glances and veiled smiles each time. I saw you check my hand and I checked yours. It's ok. You were in a gray shirt and jeans. What was I in? Maybe we could run into each other again.

For the handsome fellow jogging up Old Highway 30 from Rowena yesterday

You were jogging up Old Highway 30 in the rain yesterday afternoon, towards Rowena Crest, and I passed you driving down in the opposite direction... you were wearing glasses and a (knit?) cap and yours was such a genuine and friendly smile when our eyes met for a moment. If you happen across this, I'd love to know your name and invite you to a beer at the Thirsty Woman!

You kept starring at me. At first I thought it was creepy but then realized you were looking in my eyes and not at my chest or backside. I went to check out and you followed into the next line ahead of me. Maybe a connection there. Me: blonde with blue eyes. Beige plaid dress. You?    


Randi from TWAM - m4w

Ladies, do you hate your small breasts? DON'T! - m4w

Ladies, do you HATE your small breasts? Well, I'm here to tell you that they, and you, are beautiful. While this society has pounded in our heads that breast size is an indicator of femininity, it is not. I am a gentleman who does not find every woman attractive, but that is just human nature. Some may say "You're too small" or "Get a boob job",but don't listen to them, they are just judgemental losers who hate themselves, and cope by shaming others. Shame on them, really. You are beautiful, smart, and capable of love and compassion. Your body is a true work of art. It is admired by true gentlemen, and envied by other women. In my opinion, the large breasted woman, that uses them to get things, are trash, worthy of the trailer park. So what if you choose to be athletic, so what if you are concerned with your health, you are attractive in your smallness. A cup is awesome, and B is beautiful. Your chest is perfect, just the way it is. I have always been attracted to the small breasted woman, for they tend to be smarter. So the next time you feel like everyone is judging you by your breast size, just remember, there are successful men out there that would love to love you. For you are pretty. You are gorgeous. You are feminine beauty at its finest. You are woman. Thank you for just being you. You are loved.

Pussy Power from Hawaii - w4w

I helped you at my work on Sunday before i left for the night. You're a tall, lovely goddess in all black. I'd love to know your name and get to know you. 


Why? - m4w

Why do you people keep flagging my ads? I have reread every one of the ones that are getting flagged off, and looked all through the cl tos and I can't find what is wrong with my posts. If I'm doing something wrong let me know and I'll fix it, if I'm not and you are just flagging because you have a button, don't. I post here so my darling, my baby, the love of my life can see and read my thoughts. And maybe let me have a second chance. If I'm super lucky.    


Communication - m4w

Today being the first day of what it is, I have been thinking about communication. I never realized how much it meant to me that we could message each other all day. I didn't appreciate how reassuring it is to get messages from you at random throughout the day.  I have always thought of myself as an independent guy who doesn't need reassuring. But now I see how much I enjoyed getting your messages. And most of the time it wasn't that you were always sending me "I'm still here" messages, just random messages jokes to comments to thoughts, ideas, I loved them all. I have always thought of them as a sigh that you are thinking of me and want to talk to me. Now there's a boundary there, and I'm beginning to see how much I miss that. I miss you so much.  I want you back, I want us to be us again. I know that I screwed up, but I also know that we can get through this and be stronger for it. Not that I ever want to do this again.

Falls creek cave on 10-9-16 around 2pm - m4w

I feel like this is a long shot I wish we could've been able to speak longer, you were heading out of falls creek cave with your friend and i was heading in and we spoke briefly and you told me my accent sounded delicious, if by chance you see this hit me up i'd love to meet you and possibly do cool stuff like adventures to the lava tube. And thanks for the compliment again.: )    


it's a good day to have a good day - m4w

You are this amazing woman that was put here.  You are so beautiful.  Very beautiful.  You are a bright spot.  Openly positive, and can light up the room with your smile.  You've made my day with just eye contact and the most beautiful smile.  You have the prettiest eyes.  A bright smile.  It's that moment you are passionate and portrays a very strong woman.  You take care of yourself.  You are you. That's what's amazing. Stay beautiful.  One mind, one heart.


Menzies - m4w

I think your beautiful, I wish I knew who you were.  If only you knew I think you are cute, and I take a chance and talk to you.  I wish I would just ask you.  I want to know who you are.  


Poni - m4w

I really doubt you would ever respond to one of these.  I hope you like them though.  When I first met you I was caught up in your beauty.  Since then I have been so very amazed by those other parts of you - looking forward to a broader understanding of who you are.  Missed you tonight, hope to see you again soon.  I want to send you flowers, I want to assure you that you're so very special.

On the orange line after midnight - w4m

We caught the last Orange line to Milwaukie from downtown. I was on my phone but saw you looking at me. Tii ou tried to take a nap but we're staring at me when I got up right before my stop. I could see you on the reflection fron the window, but was too shy to turn around...

Re: You, The Lone Wolf - w4m

How can you expect forgiveness when you are still so emotionally stunted? Craigslist is the best you could do? Cowards will always remain tight in the bud.

Your hugs - m4w

I miss your hugs. The way your hands feel on my back, the way your hair smells as you nuzzle into my beard, the way out bodies attract each other like magnets making our hugs full body hugs. I miss the way that when ever one of us goes to the others house the first thing we do is give each other an amazing hug.  There is nothing like being held close by the woman I love enjoying each other's body pressed together to make one. I miss you so much it hurts


On Goats and Cats In Public Office

I miss you. 


i have to be honest, S - w4m

sometimes i really miss you. i think it was really good that we both stopped whatever we had, but, deep in my heart, i miss you. maybe not you so much, but the idea of you. the idea that we might one day be together, that we might hold each other and live out all the fantasies we had of everyday life. like simply laying in bed all day watching videos, or going out to eat at weird ethnic food joints, or heating up frozen pizza, or buying trash from thrift stores, or going hiking, or taking pictures with each other, or just. holding each other. maybe it's because i've yet to truly be held by someone that i've actually loved that i long for such a feeling, but who knows.

Hey dude - I thought you were sexy - but the guy on duty was annoying me - Not sure what I would have done with you because I tend to be very reserved there but im down for connecting outside of that place.  I noticed you trying to get my attn    


You, the Lone Wolf. - m4w

Another day passed where I haven't spoken to you. With each day I drift further and further from your mind but your spell hasn't dissipated yet. I dont know that it ever will. The last time you text me, I deleted everything. All the texts, pictures, videos, voice messages. I wish you could find it in your heart to forgive me, but you never will. Only hope I have is that you will see this and realize how much I truly miss you. How much you truly mean to me. I'm sorry.    


Freddy's Gateway - m4w

You were in front of me in line around 4pm Sunday and got a little clumsy with your card, sending it flying and nearly taking out an eye.


You were deaf, I gave you sandwiches - w4m

You were near one of the max stops in Hillsboro. You handed me a note telling me you were deaf. I came back and gave you and your friend two sandwiches and a soda. I finger spelled to you a little bit. Id like to get to know more about you. If you believe this is you, email me what kind of sandwich I gave you.    


Exchanged smiles - m4w

Your eyes met mine and we smiled at each other, then again in passing.  We smiled at each other.  It felt like we might like each other.  I wish we had a chance to talk. 


we talked about our sons after class - m4w

You will probably never see this, and I probably shouldn't post this, but curiosity has gotten the best of me. I am so attracted to you and have been for awhile. After conversing with you today and looking into you beautiful blue eyes I am more attracted to you than ever. If by chance you see this reply please. Tell me what our conversation was about and where we were.

Whales and polar bears - m4m

You came into eat at the restaurant I was working at a few days ago. You were with a friend and we had a fun conversation about polar bears and their ability to take out a blue whale. 


Alex, Waiter at Lloyd Center Applebees - m4m

My husband and I came in for a late lunch today, Sunday October 9. You were our waiter...we both thought you were super cute :) felt a little chemistry but it was hard to tell. If you're interested, we all should hang ;) 


you mad bro?

your news feed  not loading fast enough for you so it's time to hit the trailer park?  i bet your 'friends' don't even know.    


You come into my work and bookstore - m4m

Chase you come into my work and I've seen you at adult bookstores. I wanna play with you, we have never played before! I think it'd be fun and we live in the same area so easy to hook up. 


Rosa Parks Stop Max Yellow Line - m4w

We met on the Max heading to North East from downtown on Friday and i invited you to a concert that evening but it was sold out so i left and have no clue if you actually tried to go or not.  Anyway i thought you seemed cool and i know it's a ridiculous long shot but since we actually talked about craigslist missed connections during our conversation i figured what the hell...  "You're beautiful."    


Nancy. . .I totally miss you ! - m4w

Nancy!    I have thought often about you, and miss connecting with you. . . You coming into my room at night, giggling. . . our embraces, touch, play. . .etc.  . .   How you made me feel, and what you offered me, was awesome!  You always came around 10:00pm, and You never stayed long( maybe a couple of hours)   I so regret never kissing you, or deepening our relationship . . . .and was always wanting to interact with you, food wise, or watch a movie, or just hang. . .    You said that you got a boyfriend, but I think that you wanted more of me, and got tired of waiting. . . . but I was too dumb to see that!   Again, I regret it. . .  Being with you was the most happy, erotic, and comfortable times I have spent with a woman. . .  If you see this, tell me what kind of car you bought, while we were seeing each other. . .  I hope to kiss you, and hold you, and tell you how important you are to me!    Jeff

MLK Starbucks - w4m

Saw you around noon on Sunday at Starbucks. You drove a black Prius C and had a variety of tattoos, light eyes, perhaps around 30. You looked quite familiar. I was wearing all black workout gear. I'd like to chat. I doubt you'll read this, but if you do send me a picture so I know it's you.    


Firstenburg Lifeguard - m4w

You seemed to be hovering a bit around my son and I on Friday afternoon. You had a great smile and I'd love to chat.    


Blonde on main street by Safeway - m4w

you were walking in a tan dress and you looked amazing. are you a model or something?    


Oh Neighbor - w4m

You know, when you make escapist comments about other women to my man, he passes them on to me. We find it amusing. Maybe you're just trying to bond with him, but even though he's charismatic, he's terrible at that and just tells me everything. I know your wife wouldn't be up for it, but if you want to come watch or play, he wouldn't mind.    


TW for JM - m4w

What I have isn't necessarily a missed connection, as there was one before...this feels more like dropped, and I'm seeking to reconnect or at least ask why.  I know you're busy with everything going on, but to go from our conversation to no response at all was a shock.  What happened? Was it me? J, I've never felt like this for someone so quickly, and I don't want to lose it...though I feel it's already lost.  I feel like a match, we met and over 2 days the flame ignited, burnt bright during our conversations, now feebly trying to stay lit.

RE: Hb to B

To my handsome man - w4m

Feeling sleepless? That's just me coming to peek in on you while you are sleeping, me in spirit, while your spirit is flying in the dreams of night. I visit inviting your spirit to fly with mine with dreams and in the waking times to hear my voice and enjoy conversation with me when the going gets tough and remorse rolls deep.

Missing sleeping next to you - m4w

I miss you so much. I miss us going to bed, our whole routine of you trying to move me around so you are comfortable, resisting just a little just to play with you for a minute. I miss you next to me finally getting me on my side so you can cuddle up to my cooler side. I miss you behind me when you finally get comfortable and throw your arm over my side and across my chest. I miss how we would separate a little in our sleep and come back to each other and give each little loving comforting squeezes just to let each other know that they were still there. I love you so very much. 


Roller coatser - m4w

So we talked today, and I really enjoyed spending time with you. There is no one on the planet whom I'd rather spend time with. I know that you are still angry with me, and after we talked tonight I'm terribly afraid that I'm going to end up in the black hole called the friend box of no escape. I don't want to just be friends. I want to be your partner. I want you to be my partner. For the rest of our lives. Just us together, though you need to learn how to stay in bed for extra cuddles on the weekend mornings. I love you just the way you are. I am filled with remorse for what I did a week ago. I'm so sorry. I never wanted to hurt you in any way. I love you more than life itself.

Your wife was hitting on my wife tonight( after a couple of drinks) .. are you two interested in something more?

Mio sushi - m4w

You are a very pretty blond, you were there by yourself.  I sat down facing you and I tried to be polite and not stare. I wanted to come sit with you, I was thinking to myself is she lonely right now? And trying to get over someone like I am? Why is she here alone I thought? She's very pretty and has a smoking hot body,she's not wearing a ring!! But I'm just not darring enough or I'm to polite to approach a woman under those circumstances. So I'm reaching out hoping by chance that you read this.

Adopted siblings looking for other sisters! - w4w

Hello, my name is Abby. I was adopted at a very young age and I am looking for my birth siblings. I have already found my three older siblings, one half brother, one half sister, and one full blood sister. I am still looking for our three younger half sisters. Our mother had custody of them up until 1994 and then they were adopted out. I don't even know if they know they were adopted. The information we have is as follows. The format is odd because craigslist doesn't like you to post phone numbers so any sequence of four or more numbers is restricted.


Solo at Okkervil River - m4w

We stood at the cross walk mixed in a large group, you were wearing a black beanie, sweater, jeans, and smoking a cigarette as we both approached the doorman at the Wonder Ballroom. I decided to go to the show alone, and I wondered if you did too. I grabbed a beer and later realized I was standing behind you the whole show about 4 rows in from the stage. Okkervil River is one of my favorite bands, and I wondered - this woman seems very cool (she went to the concert solo just as I did), and I wonder if she would want to go to concerts with me? Then, I had to run halfway through the encore to catch the last bus..... and other than a smile, that was it.

Clay you have a really nice body. You post a ton of shirtless selfies and it's a major turn on looking at those pecs. Would you ever consider meeting another down low dude for something discreet? I'm friends on fb with you even though we don't know each other that well. I know it's a long shot but it's worth trying.    


Hazel room - m4w

I was there with a blind date that did not have chemistry.  You where the next table over with what seemed like your mother. When my date was in the bathroom you struck up conversation about the village building convergence and it felt like we should talk more.  If you somehow find this post- perhaps we could have a date?

Griz at Roseland Friday night - m4w

I was wearing that goofy-ass outfit and sat next to you on the upper balcony during the openers while I  waited for some friends. You're a ballet dancer from Oakland with awesome hair and you just moved up here and went to the show alone. You ended up hanging out and dancing with us for most of the evening, but on the way out we lost each other! I was hoping to get more than just your name -- you seem really cool and are very beautiful!

Grocery store connection with a beautiful RN - m4w

I've never really thought about making a connection with a lovely lady while shopping for groceries but last Thursday night 10/6 around 9:00 pm it happened.  I was picking up some goodies at my neighborhood Safeway on Andresen when I caught the glance of this pretty lady as I walked in the store. The funny thing is we kept running into each ovther throughout the store while we were shopping which got kinda weird so I commented to her that I wasn't a stalker and she was so cute she responded back are you sure with this radiant smile.  We even ended up at the check out together and I found out she's an RN, she eats healthy and she pegged how much her basket was going to cost her.

Friday evening - Cheesecake server - w4m

Tall, dark and handsome, you offered to help me with anything I wanted.  Wasn't sure if I got your meaning.    


Of course I know.

If someone is posting here for me it's because they're fucking around trying to be funny.  I already seen who you were with now. I don't expect you to want to be with me. Half the time I don't want to be with me either.  Keep going.    


Bar back at CC Blooms - m4m

You are the bar back at CC Blooms you serverd me Jell-O shots all night and they where delicious. I don't know if I'm stepping my bounds or not but you are super cute and would like to get to know you.. I'm working for our company this way so if you need any housing work let me know...    


Trying to understand - m4w

We met for dinner, and enjoyed some good conversation until the noisy unattended kids in the next booth got way too loud. We went to a quieter place to continue our conversation. It was bluntly honest and I think it was very good. You laughed at my uh, personal story. Then you asked to see the ring I was going to propose to you with a week from today. I showed you. And it seemed like you withdrew, you got very quiet. Then you needed to leave, you were tired, it was late, and you needed to get home. I told you that I wanted to marry you. That i still want to marry you. That you are my everything, you are my first thought when I wake up, and my last thought before I fall asleep. I love you so very much. Re:VHA    


Gorgeous hot blonde Safeway 39th and Powell - m4w

All Black, #17 Bus Friday Night - m4w

You were wearing a new black jacket and hat with an "I heart sex" pin on it, and some amazing perfume.  You gave the "what's up?" look to me and this guy in the front of the bus with an oxygen tank.  I fell in love immediately.  You had an awesome hunched over posture and started rocking out to some electronica (I'm guessing).  I was still in my work clothes, a duck canvas work jacket and an old baseball cap, on my way home from my friends art show.  You had the most beautiful lines on your face.  I wanted to talk to you, but was afraid I would scare you away from riding the bus in the future, plus you were surrounded by a bunch of nerds.  Eventually you got off the bus, but not before strutting your stuff.  You didn't thank the bus driver, which made me like you slightly less.  I lamented all night.    


The greatest smile in town - m4w

I've come in to shop at varying times in the day and every time I see you at your post, your smile catches me off guard. I can tell you're a warm, caring person just by the way our eyes meet and you light up. I'm sure you light up for all your customers, but I get butterflies anyway.

Shelby, Blonde Hair amazing Soul! From Portland - m4w

Shelby from Portland, I know this is a long shot searching again to get in touch with you. It's been a long time since we had that meaningful discussion near the bar in Portland and I still feel like we have unfinished ties. I had such an amazing time with you the last time we saw each other even if it was just for the brief moment in time. I apologize for having to cut it short due to my brothers inconvenience in timing and my lack of preparation. I wish I would have been able to drive my own vehicle in order to allow us more time together that day. 


when asked

Here is a normal response..


Green tea w/honey - m4w

We met at a dive bar and while we got to know each other, ONE guy asked FOUR times if we were together. I don't want to seem assuming to you so I played it cool.  Knowing what I know now, I woulda said hell yes. Later that night you invited me to stay with you but we stayed at a motel instead. "I won't try anything" I said. So much for that idea. I'm glad I tried something THREE times that night and the next morning. Later we had breakfast and I had green tea with honey. I never wanted to leave that morning and I still don't. I guess what I'm saying is jinkys, I sure do hope you have a swell weekend.

I'm the 6th person to be right along in full BLOOM.  Now ma'am riddle me this. If lightening strikes does it fill you with rubber? You're not shocking! Now we had our last day at work and you were all judging me my first day knowing I was bullshitting all of you.. yuplease I've never done construction or masonry but somehow.. I answered all the questions right never failed and exceeded my job and.m it freaked you out.. I'm no alien sorry to burst your bubble... they just dont.. exist! IT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD. Unless your blind and have lazy eyes. This is a matrix and I take shots in the dark like a stripper with her eyes cut out. I don't care for your skin color but I am a joker and a.. hippie but I think you're a waste of human space. Glad today was our last day together I'm tired of being the only one who can lift all the heavy stuff!    


I complimented your Ink, called me HandsomE - m4w

we talked at the register. It was respectful, therefore I am here. while leaving the parking lot, in the lane Next to you,I commented a specific Piece of Ink. You said thanks Handsome. I know your Car was a dodge, and thought the passenger was your man. Either way, your eyes where intense Also could be speculated that you maybe go faster than the rest, as I do. If so......

Looking for Julie Howard - m4w

Hi CLers, I am hoping to find an old friend of mine who used to be named Julie Howard.  She may have gotten married again, so don't know if this is her current last name.  But she used to go to City Bible church at Mill Plane campus.  She has two boys, and was married last time we talked, but may have moved on.   Anyway, if you know her, tell her an old friend that used to run a night club in Portland (she will know who I am) would like to re-connect with her.  I know this is a long shot, but who knows.


Wednesday night smile - m4w

I was leaving class at PCC Sylvania late Wednesday night with a classmate and you left the classroom next door in front of us. You turned around and smiled at me, holding eye contact for what felt like a long time. I thought you were attractive, but I was too sick to think straight and also in the middle of a conversation with my classmate. I'd love to know more about you and that smile. Maybe I'll see you next week?

You're my boss - m4w

you work above me but I swear there's something between us. You drag your breasts across my back when you're scooting by and when we look at each other I'm always the first to look away and you keep hitting my butt when you walk by... I'm confused because you talk about your fiancee all the time. you're really attractive to me and if you didn't constantly talk about your fiancee I would be receptive to you.

We Played Everquest Together - m4w

We played EQ together for a short time back when it was new.  I felt a connection to you that's never left.  You moved out of state and we never talked again.  It's a super longshot, considering you moved out of Oregon, but if you think this could be you, write and say hi!    


Glances at Maharaja - m4w

Really regretting not saying hello.  You were the beautiful blond woman eating at the table next to me.  I was wearing a blue shirt and glasses, you had crutches and a short haircut.  I was seated behind you, by the door.  Couldn't see you directly, but you glanced back a few times in my direction.  Being three feet away I couldn't help but check you out.  Wanted to say hi, but you were with a friend and I didn't want to interrupt.  Would love to connect.

I hope it's not to late for forever - m4w

I don't know if you understand what you say and expect me to do when you say I am childish and that all the other people understood what was going and that our relationship is too much... I understand you are gonna do your thing if there is money I expect you to go get it but the way you already had everything planned you left without saying goodbye no kiss nothing just gone  and then didn't pick up your phone which didn't help the situation all I am saying is I love you with all of me but I am beginning to feel like I need to put my guard up so I don't get hurt I am also starting to not care about things that usually matter which is not good I always tell you this I will never play second to anybody or anything and that's exactly what you made me feel yesterday but it's all good now  because I know that I can't love you like that anymore I have to look out for myself because that was a bad situation this morning and I don't want to feel like that again

Olga of 24 hour fitness Andresen, we met a few months ago inparkinglot - m4w

A few months ago at night (~9PM?)  I came across you and your car as I was walking towards my car. I complimented you on your BMW. We had a nice little conversation about penny stocks and you asked me if I was going to work out now. I said no and you said to feel free to talk to you if I see you in the gym again.


Re: surface level stuff - w4m

i deleted the post because i didn't want to confuse anyone else. i'm not looking to meet a romantic partner. i'm sorry to hear so many of you are having trouble connecting in your lives.


That ass at Tigard Transit Center - m4w

I see you a few times a week taking the commuter train from Tigard to Beaverton. I can tell its you from behind. Your cute glasses and beautiful booty drive me wild. I don't expect anything to come of this, but just know. The guy with the hoodie and shoulder pack loves every second he gets a glimpse of you! I can't even help it! You are on fire!    


Don't know what to say.

Obviously you're still on my mind enough to post this.  Whenever I need some someone I wonder about what it would be like if I had a family, a support system. Then I think about what it would be like if you and I had stayed friends, and I could call you, but one day you stopped taking my calls and I haven't spoken to you since.

To the best lover I have ever known - m4w

Are lives were difficult and it was never easy.  But I need you to know I think of you almost every day/night.  I still have the wildest Memories of us and have wild fantasy's of the things we used to do.  You were older then me and I know you were uncomfortable with that.  Until we would start to kiss and you would turn into a sexed crazed vixen.  We would lose each other for a while and then find it each other again.  Our lives would be different, but our connection remained the same.  I want you to know that you taught me so much about myself.  I think of us all the time and I hope you are doing well.  If you think this might be you and you care to respond, feel free to contact me.  I will give you a hint, because I don't know if you are still married. Think "Farm House". Love ya still! S

Roomy - m4w

You rent a room in my house with our dogs. You are much younger than me and use a shortened first name that could be a boy's name. You seem to be a little self conscience / shy about your body. You probably think you are overweight or at the least don't want to get that way. Maybe you hide yourself because you don't want me to get the wrong ideas. But I think you are gorgeously hot, very cute, love the curves. I can't help but look. Especially when you don't wear a bra and have one of your short dresses/skirts on. I will never barge in on you, will always try to give you privacy. But if you ever want to climb into my bed next to me some night even if just to have someone warm next to you while you sleep you will not be rejected.

I feel like there is nothing to live for if I can't share my life with another,oh how my heart pains for the love of a woman,I feel so lost cold and alone in this world,I feel like I'm sinking into the ground deeper each day one step closer to being the last day for me,I don't know how long I can last or how much more loneliness I can take,alone it seems I break.

Hey Beautiful - m4w

Dont know if you'll ever see this but I just had to put it out there in the universe and say that I miss u. You've been on my mind alot this month. I even dreamt about you the other day which is weird because i haven't dreamt in a while. I hope you are in a good place and you are happy. Last time we spoke you said you were married and happy, thats all I wanted for you. That's why i haven't contacted you again. I don't want to get in the way of your happiness. I hope you can understand. Just know i'll always have love for you. Maybe we will meet in the next life and get a fresh start. Until then I wish you love.

still stuck - w4m

on you CR...  on all of the things you said and didn't say.   all I want is another chance to act right and all I would ask you is:


LBCC Parking structure - w4m

I was driving out of the school parking lot around 5:50 PM and saw a guy check me out and because we were in the parking structure i had to drive past him twice. I asked him if he needed to cross and used a hand signal to say he could but the car behind me though i said to go around me. Anyways, he asked if i needed a parking spot (even though there were so many empty spaces cause no one really has night classes today) and i got flustered and said "oh sorry. I dont. Oh. Never mind." And he shouted goodbye to me as i drove off into the sunset.

Marshalls - Traffic Circle - Today 10/8 - m4m

McDonald's on PCH in Seal Beach - m4m

You were in line this morning 10/8 and I let you go ahead of me. Think you were on your way to work, wearing a hat and work clothes.


Still missing you - w4m

Standing on the beach today and watching the waves gently roll against the sand, your memory came flooding in like the tide. I don't know where we went wrong...maybe it was neglect, bitterness and resentment is why we fell apart. So much hurt was caused. I still sometimes dream of you and our family together again. I see you smiling and laughing and holding monster man in your arms...and I wake up feeling so broken and empty. Almost 8 months later and I'm still drifting between loving you and moving on. It's hard for a heart to let go of hope. It's one of the hardest things I have done. Walking away after several years of turbulence have left me relieved, but heartbroken at the same time. I hope you are happy and I hope you are achieving everything you could want in this life. I still pray your path will be kind to you. Day by day...    


Montrose T-shirt in Wasteland - m4w

Hello,


For October - w4m

One day you'll love me the way I loved you and you'll understand why I needed you so. I'm not a model anymore. I'm not a beautiful thing to look at. All these women that don't look exhausted and all have teams of people waiting on them hand and foot. Me? I slave away day after day working for a whole lot of nothing. It doesn't bother you that I'm hurting, need held, need you to be that sweet guy vulnerable and not putting on a show. You don't have to be afraid of photographers publishing photos of you. You don't have to threaten them. I saw you as you really are. Outside of controlled circumstances where you can be the best actor to ever live. You don't have to be your false self with me. I hope you find what you need most.

drifting out to sea - m4w

Floating away into hours, days, years of meaningless existence. Time has forgotten me but the sea has not. It carries me as I lay on my back staring into the endless blue skies. But I am not happy. I am thankful to have the sunset and sunrise. I am soothed by the stars and moon, alone I might be, but I surrounded by others who are drifting with me. We cross paths but we barely speak a word. How I wish I could find a new home among this vast world of constants, routines, endless tides, waves, As I lay on my back my head halfway under water I hear sounds, maybe it's old memories playing back like an old record? Voices are muffled. As I drift farther out of sight I am heading towards a storm on the horizon. I do not want to go there but I am not fighting what is coming. Alas bring me the rain, bring me the wind, bring Me the thunder the lightning. Bring me the end.

Tania - m4w

This is Francisco. I know you're on here writing poetry about me. You must think I'm some sort of saint or angel and let me just tell you that you're wrong. I'm no angel, nor am I a demon. I'm a person with flaws, just like you. I have light and dark in me and am capable of both. I don't know for certain if you wrote that last one about me being friends with the devil (whatever that means) but If it was you, I got a kick out of that. I don't know why you want try to paint as some sort of monster but maybe you've noticed lately that I'm starting to get wise to what you're doing and that I plan on moving on and this guilt trip is an attempt to try and get me to change my mind but I have just a few things to say and I'll try to be as nice as possible about it.

Thank You for your smile - m4w

For years I have walked around the Silverlake reservoir. Many of those years have been lived feeling intense loneliness and isolation. For years I have around around the reservoir simply to not feel the ptsd or the loneliness so intensely. Often I found no reason for my continued existence. I simply didn't have the courage to do myself in.  Thank god that often when I walked around the reservoir a beautiful woman would smile at me. I never pursued that smile because of the way I felt about myself. Not good enough for someone else.

Beautiful Blonde in My Red Mustang in 2011 - m4w

A little over 5 years ago, I responded to an ad on Craigslist you posted looking for someone to hook up with in the middle of the night. You were more than a little tipsy, and I was intrigued. We ended up exchanging a few e-mails, and I agreed to come meet up with you. I believe you were in the Costa Mesa area. It was super late and you know, five years ago, so forgive my memory here. I know we weren't too terribly far from the beach in a somewhat decent neighborhood. I picked you up and we found a quiet spot... we didn't end up having sex, but I pleasured you for quite a long time. You were probably 20-21 around that time and I was 29. I was driving a red Mustang convertible with a tan top.

If you see this and let me know what I was wear. I would like to lick snow off your face.

No one else - m4w

Comes close. No one. You've brought back and jump started what i have been missing in my life. You're the one that literally brought me back to life. As silly as it seems, you are my sunshine. Hell, my one and only sunshine. I miss you. I want you. I need you. I'm madly in love with you. No one else comes close. No one else will take your place. No one else can or will make me feel the way i do..only you. I now believe in love at first sight. Which with you..was years ago. From the first time. And time passed. Second time. Swept me and took my breath away. Stopped me dead in my tracks. And time passed. And then a third encounter. For sure that's when i knew. Wasn't just a silly isolated feeling that sent me straight floating on cloud 9. And partially knowing you just solidified that feeling for it has only made me fall for you even more. You're the one. The one that i have been waiting for all my life. The one whom my heart and soul belongs to. I can't stop thinking about you about us. What next? what now? I guess in time we'll both know. Despite how the situation and the circumstances. I still want to know if it is, mutual. I found you. At last. Only took forever. But now the search is over. For with you i see forever. I love you so much. I love you so much..i love you. I Love You. I LOVE YOU.

Comes close. No one. You've brought back and jump started what i have been missing in my life. You're the one that literally brought me back to life. As silly as it seems, you are my sunshine. Hell, my one and only sunshine. I miss you. I want you. I need you. I'm madly in love with you. No one else comes close. No one else will take your place. No one else can or will make me feel the way i do..only you. I now believe in love at first sight. Which with you..was years ago. From the first time. And time passed. Second time. Swept me and took my breath away. Stopped me dead in my tracks. And time passed. And then a third encounter. For sure that's when i knew. Wasn't just a silly isolated feeling that sent me straight floating on cloud 9. And partially knowing you just solidified that feeling for it has only made me fall for you even more. You're the one. The one that i have been waiting for all my life. The one whom my heart and soul belongs to. I can't stop thinking about you about us. What next? what now? I guess in time we'll both know. Despite how the situation and the circumstances. I still want to know if it is, mutual. I found you. At last. Only took forever. But now the search is over. For with you i see forever. I love you so much. I love you so much..i love you. I Love You. I LOVE YOU.

I wanted to walk back over to you but i didnt work up the nerve to, I regret it already. When i started walking back i turned the corner but you were gone already. I got in my car and just drove down the street to see if you were up ahead. I wish i would have said something right then and there. I know this is a long shot but if you see this and if there was something there between us, i would like to get to know you. Reply and tell me whaylt city we were in

I was trying to park at the 365 yesterday (Monday 10.10) when I spotted you getting in to your Volvo SUV. You stopped and gave me some pretty intense eye contact. When I rounded the corner and doubled back you were in your car still looking at me. Maybe I had something in my teeth? Maybe you were trying to say "I'm leaving. Take my spot." Write me back and let's get to the bottom of it.    


You: white, married, very fit, heteroflexible; me: little, Asian mouth - w4m

And after the party closed, one of my friends called a ride. While we were waiting, I made eye contact with you a few times - of course, it was while my ride was on the way. You were very, very handsome - and it seems like you thought the same of me, because as we passed each other you said "Have a good night" (or something similar - I was excited, okay!) and I just said "Hey."

Can't get over you and you suck for leaving - w4m

Should of got this off my chest a few months ago.... I can't believe you'd say you love me and leave? You don't walk away from someone you love. Here I am 3 months later still pathetically not over you. I don't even know why you were so special to me but you were, I think you really suck for leaving and you're a coward for doing so, you were suppose to be here for me and teach me how to love, yet I'm here heart broken with so much love to give, I miss you so much.... love j.    


Is it a sign? - w4m

So out of no where I look down and on my living room floor is a key card to a hotel room. I open it up and it's from the hotel we went to on our first trip together around this time a year ago. The trip where you told me you loved me and wanted to be with me.... Where it came from or how it appeared is beyond me. I've moved 2 times since and it just randomly shows up on my living room floor? With nothing else around it. Is it a sign? Maybe? I don't even know anymore. I'm just trying to move on with my life and for some reason I feel myself missing you heavy lately. And I don't know or understand why. Seeing that just made me remember how happy I used to be..... What happened?

You leaned forward to grasp the package and your beautiful natural  breasts were visible down the top of your low cut nightgown. I said, "nice". You said thank-you and winked at me.

I havent felt such an instant connection with anyone like I did with you; you made me smile instantly and I cant stand thinking about how your mustache would feel brushing against my body. Tell me where we work if youre intersted in grabbing coffee...

Cute Girl I gave Leather Jacket to 6:30 PM Sherman Way/Winketa - m4w

Hey there to the cute girl waiting for the bus at about 6:30 tonight while I was fixing the 2 vans. You got cold and I gave you my leather jacket which you were kind enough to leave on one of them for me. We also had a really nice conversation about the cop who hassled me. By the time I got to and from Rite Aid across the street to give you my number you were already on the bus.

You were at 7-eleven with your friends. One of them bought a skittles slurpee. You kept smiling and staring at me and waved goodbye. I blew you a kiss in return. You're handsome and I like your tattoo. Call me    


Re: sadness-you're not sad you hypocrite - w4m

Your  post is an exercise in self indulgence to  make yourself feel better . By 46 of you haven't even  realized that people have various layers and facets and don't remain static then there is no hope for you. Even mother Theresa who is canonized had a dark night of the soul. People go through dark times, the resilient ones get up, brush off and keep moving on sometimes they have loving friends and family sometimes they don't. One day when you're all alone and down and have hard times your precious hobbies and cars and your man child friends won't help you because they don't know how. The one person who has experienced light and dark and can manage her heart and loves you won't be there because you used her and left her. She will be ok, she has safety net of family and friends and all the positive energy she poured out into people. While self absorbed, selfish, self centered and entitled you will regret with every inch of your fiber that the strong, loving, loyal person you let go because you thought her love for you was her weakness. You loved her when she was an exotic stranger to you, when she was a living breathing real human being, you bailed. You lied, you manipulated. Did you ever make her feel cherished?  you couldn't even stop chatting with exes and you expected her to feel secure. A woman needs to know her man is loyal to her but what do you know about loyalty, you woman hopping, multiple dating womanizer.


Santa Monica beach - m4w

You were laying in the sand with no towel, went swimming a couple times and laid down again in the sand on your clothes. Black bikini bottom, black and blue/purple top.


re sadness - w4m

I think this Post was not meant for me and I apologize for posting in any way that might have hinted it was. But just in case if it truly was..This girl you're describing, is not and was not me..ever. I have never been adventurous, fun or exciting even. My Husband fell in love with me because I was quiet, predictable and honored his every move. My husband was quite opposite of fun or adventurous, except when it came to his job, but even his job was not about seeing the world or exploring the unknown. He was very conservative, scholarly and If he was not at work he had a different book in front of his face almost every week, Penn State Graduate.  He liked a wee bit of whiskey from time to time but never even smoked a joint in his life. Every Shirt in his closet was either a Van Huesen Luxe Sateen (He was only 27 when we met) or a mens Dickie Plaid Camp Button down, Both of which I always made sure were pressed divine and every pair of shoes aligned beneath to follow.

Looking diligently for this man. He is 6'3" and close to retiring. You sent me a message on a dating site that by the time I read it, you were a "deleted user" so I was unable to respond. Randy, the things you wrote to me were absolutely amazing. I would really like the opportunity to meet you. I hope this gets to you somehow and you respond.

Bar Covell - m4w

I saw you, seated at the bar (greenish shirt, shoulder length hair) with a friend on Thursday night. We made eye contact and I uncontrollably mouthed "hello" like a bumbling idiot. You certainly noticed. I wanted to say hello but you were with a friend, I was with a friend, etc. 


My heart is yours... - m4w

Marta G. I miss you and think of you when I look at the night sky. I am dumbfounded with confusion. We shared a beautiful evening at the beach. We embraced & kissed as the waves crashed against the rocks. Then, in the blink of an eye I went from being loved to being crushed. You may never fully understand what you meant to me. I hope wherever you are, your heart ceases to hurt & you find that love that truly is yours.

sadness - m4w

She had no idea how badly I wanted her. I was so incredibly happy when I finally got her. Unfortunately, the girl I was so madly in love with is not the girl I got. The girl I got was broken--lacking the spark of the girl she used to be. The fun, exciting, adventurous person I loved was now depressed, obsessive, and afraid. I saw glimpses of the girl I fell in love with, but those glimpses were few and far between. Even the broken bird that I found in place of the girl I fell in love with, I loved deeply--possibly more than anyone ever. Unfortunately, no matter how hard I tried, nothing I did would help. I would have given almost anything to help bring her back to herself. To pull her back from the darkness...the self-destructive path to which she was rooted. Nothing worked. I nearly lost myself and everything else I loved in the attempt. Time has passed, and my life has recovered. Now I know that she can only find healing from within. She has to make the choice to try. To live. To be happy. I hope she does. If she ever finds that girl I fell in love with, I would like to say hello.    


Egg Heaven cafe!! - m4m

You opened the door for me and my friend! I clearly saw you freeballing and I think you noticed me looking! You even grabbed your cock on your way to the restroom right in front of me! I wouldn't mind deepthroating that cock! Hope you read this!!!

At the end of the program we chuck hands and chatted briefly, tell me what we said and what the program was about.

Beautiful woman at coffee bean and tea leaf 3pm - m4w

Good afternoon!  I know this won't go anywhere but had to say how beautiful you are and how crazy it is that we've crossed paths 3 times this week.  First, you showed up at Picnic with a to-go order wearing a stunning green dress.  Next was starbucks in the 2029 building in a gorgeous blue dress.  Finally today in an amazing white/black combo at Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf.  Obviously I should have taken this as a sign and said hi, but we both always went separate directions.  I doubt you took note, but I definitely did!  Next week if we end up at the same place, I will definitely introduce myself. 


Music Tastes Good - m4w

Ok this is a little crazy but you were in front of me at the Music Taste Good festival during the Specials set. You had dark hair, you are beautiful, tattoo on your right shoulder, and a Black Flag T-Shirt. We exchanged many smiles during the evening and I probably bounced off of you a few times when it got rowdy.

You asked me if I was hungry - m4w

I was waiting at the light and you pulled up alongside me, rolled your window down and asked me if I was hungry. I couldn't hear you so I approached the car and stated 'pardon me'. You started to clear off your passenger seat and repeated the question. I replied with, 'no, not really'. We exchanged a few more polite words and we both went on our way.


Red shirt on the 16 West this morning... - m4m

Hey man! We locked eyes a couple times, but it was early and we both seemed to have our destinations set. I dug your hair, your shirt, your look, and definitely that smile...would like to chat and maybe hang out, too bad I am such an earphone zombie in the mornings, and a total slacker about initiating conversation...here's hoping I catch a chance...

Beautiful girl with curly hair at CSUN Upstairs cafeteria - m4w

We shared a few glances while you were talking to your friend and I was on my computer. You have curly hair and what looked like a backpack made to look like a mushroom house. You wore bronze eye shadow and a brown turtleneck sweater with jeans. The moment are eyes locked for a second, my heart stopped. It's a longshot but I hope you find this    


LA Fitness Culver City - m4m

You were very turned on in the showers this morning. Your inks glistening under the water. Wanted to connect after but missed you.  Never done this before but wanted to finish what we started. Reach out if you can identify my ink and took a one in a million chance to check craigslist    


alice in chains last night - m4w

We connected eyes and as that door opened you walked in my direction as if you were a dream. You are absolutely beautiful, sexy, and hot. I can tell you this, if you see this we'll have the ultimate connection with chemistry, conversation, and fulfillment :)    


The Buck stops anywhere. - m4w

I feel stupid posting this considering that we used to make fun of them. That being saidI think about you often and hope you were able to get clear of your legal and addiction troubles. I miss hearing your voice, and seeing your beautiful smile. You were smart, witty and gorgeous. What we didn't get in quantity, we definitely made up for with quality. You were the only solace in my life at the time. I thank you for that.

Hi. I don't know why but I miss your face. Want to get together and make muffins some time? Or coffee. My number is still the same if you ever happen upon this random obscure message.    


711 Hottie - w4m

So this is a long shot but you were at the 711 on 72nd and Simms last Saturday and you were in front of me in line. You kept turning around and looking at me but I was too shy to say anything because I was looking like shit all hungover buying junk food. You talked to the cashier about what you do for a living..... impressing me maybe ? You definitely did. 


Girl Voting Papers - m4w

Don't know if you'll ever see this on here but if you do by a miracle and luck, I just wanted to say you're beautifully pretty and very cute looking :) lol, it was a pleasure and nice chatting with you. Thanks for letting me vote I guess lol, thanks for your good service. If you remember who this is, tell me what's my name and what I was wearing or who I was with. Hope you have a great wonderful day and rest of your week! :)    


Tall white woman trying to get food stamps - m4w

Would love to hook up. Get together. I was sitting right across from you like several weeks ago. You have a tattoo on your neck and was wearing blue short shorts. You were with someone there. 


Throwing a Hail Mary - m4w

We work at the same place, but my schedule is the opposite of yours.  I browse these sections of Craigslist for workplace security reasons, so I figured I would try posting here for once.  We both work for Envirotest.  You are an inspector, and I am a technician.  We have talked a few times.  I have told you that if you ever needed to talk, just knock on my office door.  You always seem so upset.  I understand that you have a lot of personal problems, and I understand what those problems are like because of my similar circumstances.  I dunno if you ever check these out, but it is easier for me to type out my thoughts than it is for me to say them.  After being beat down and turned into a second class citizen, I have my reasons, just like I suspect you have yours.  I have seen you smile before.  You should do it more often.  You are too cute of a woman to constantly wear a look of concern or anger.  Since the first time we talked, I wanted to see more of that smile.  From what I have seen, you have a good heart, but don'the know how to let it shine.  My advice for you is this:  "Smile at your problems, and don'the let the things you can't control destroy you."


Don's Mixed Drinks & Great American Beer Festival - w4m

We never exchanged names or numbers either times we met and bumped into each other. I feel like we had a good time in the short exchange we had. I'm from out of town, so maybe you wouldn't want to pursue. I think we had fun slapping each other's asses, and I would like to slap your ass again. 


Nikki from 40 bus - m4w

Looking for a young lady I had a chat with on the bus. We were both on our way to work. Kinda thought I should have got your number. If you thought so hmu    


TOAD TAVERN 10-8-16 SATURDAY - m4w

You asked me about a song we played after our set. I can't believe I let you walk away. You were so cute humming that tune. If by any chance you see this (slim at best) please reply. I would like another chance to get to know you. Littleton Station:)    


downtown hotel lobby bathroom - m4m

Dude....excellent customer service!! Loved sucking your furry cock.  I want to do it again and work on that furry ass and chest too.    Send me a pic or tell me which hotel and what happened so I know it's you!!!    


Christina Anderson are you still around? - m4w

We met years ago, but life played us a bad hand and we were separated. My name is: Cory, I'm looking for a lost love. Your name was Christina Anderson, your mom's was Mary. Remember the cold night in Tiny Town when your car broke down and I gave you my sweater to wear? Iv'e missed you and have always wondered what happened to you. You have a son named David. The last time we spoke was August 1997. If you happen to know Christina please let her know I'd like to speak to her again. I still hold your Prom picture in my wallet.    


I delivered your lunch today. Ashley?? - m4w

It's a long shot but doesn't hurt to try. I delivered your lunch to you today around 1pm. Your name is Ashley I believe. I had a black shirt and a black hat on. I called your phone # saying that I was at the back door. I think you are beautiful and seem sweet. Let's get a coffee sometime or catch a movie. 


Married female (Charlie)

It's pretty obvious the feelings between you.  Don't drag me into anything to save your own face.  You do NOT know me NOR am I a threat.  I know nothing and would never cause strife for either of you.  However YOU  WIN I have bowed out and no one wins, especially Charlie the one who deserved someone like me.    


Emily, we were at Rubios - m4w

You were getting dinner. So was I. I was in a rush to leave.


Todd from USC - m4m

We had a long online and Skype connection, but never met in person.  I got frustrated by the yes, no experience and finally sought out another FWB situation that I could actually do something other than chat and beat off on Skype with. 


Genius Bar - m4m

You helped me out with some issues that I had with my device. I have no idea if anyone ever even reads these but in the small chance it does, I would like to get to know you more. I found you extremely attractive. 


QUEST ACADEMY - m4w

I just wanted to give a shout out to QUEST ACADEMY for all the beautiful women that gather there. Many of the moms and teachers are just gorgeous! So many beautiful women I love dropping my kid off every morning. There is a thin blonde lady that walks her kids to school that is simply beautiful, I wish I could tell her. The fifth grade teacher is also really beautiful, and the P.E. teacher, and a few others. You ladies make my day, everyday.    


I wonder how many more women you have cheated on her with D - w4m

I wonder how many others you have cheated on D with.  You claim you are single and then your lies start to show.  I wonder how many others you have told that they are the one but yet it is a lie.

Northfield Target today at about 12:30 or 1pm.  You are tall, longer blond hair, wearing blue jeans, boots, a camo coat (fleece maybe) and a camo hat.  We glanced at each other when you were leaving the store and I was headed in.  I know I'm suppose to put 'Tell me something so I know it was you' but I can't imagine any two people would think it was them.  You were by yourself so I'm hoping you see this as no one else can pass it along to you.  If you get these by some miracle, please contact me.  I'd love to buy you coffee at the big building to the south.

You were with your kids and complimented the cashier on her tie-dyed bag. I have short blondish brown hair and glasses... and I happened to be parked next to your green Trailblazer. But I could ask you for your number in front of your kids (adorable kids by the way). If you happen to see this, drop my a line.    


Sorin - m4w

I was at your work today and we happened to chat when I was calibrating  a scale in your area. Just thought there might have been some conversation left unsaid. Your name started with a B, if you might happen to come across this would like to chat some more. My name also stated with a B    


I slapped your butt at Don's - w4m

I didn't get your name since I wasn't sober both times. But you lifted me over your shoulder at the Great American Beer Festival and you asked if you could kidnap me last Thursday (10/06). I should have said yes. I was wearing a burgundy colored shirt both times. We hugged but never actually introduced ourselves. I'm from out of town, so I may never see you again. Figured this was worth a shot.

I so badly wanted to flirt with you but I have reached the age that you may just see me as a creepy older guy.   If your reading this and don't mind a older creepy guy please let me know.

You have cut my hair the last few times and the looks we have exchanged are very sexual.

Not How I Saw My Life - w4m

I have been married over 5 years but less than 10 years. I have not been appreciated or truely loved in my marriage.   I just want to be treated with love, respect and like I mean something to someone. Like i'm the first thing they think about when they wake up, or when they aren't near me, i'm what they think about. I want to be someone's world (aside from their children if they have children). I am looking for someone to talk to , someone who will listen when I want to talk but even more important, someone who will listen when I want or need to vent or cry. You can be married , or single. Kids or no kids. (But i do love children). I know wanting someone with good looks maybe a little shallow? But I must be attracted to u physically and sexually. Good in bed is a must because I am not sexually compatible with my husband. If we chat, i can go into more detail about that. ;) I am looking for someone around the ages of 37-45. Make sure you change the subject to your age, favorite color and favorite football team. Attach a photo as well please.

I want to run my fingers through your curly hair while your hands are on my waist and your leading me the way I know you can. I was looking for you all weekend at the salsa convention. I thought for sure I would see you there but I didn't. I hope you see this and know its about you. I have been crushing on you from afar but now its time I make my move. If you know who you are I hope you email me and ask me to dance next time I see you. if it sounds like it might be you and your curious it doesn't hurt to find out right? who knows. you might just be my knight in shining armor that I fantasize you as. hope to hear from you. you are about 5'10" - 5'11" average build. curly brown hair. and have a smile that can bring me to my knees. please find me.

You seem to always work on your lower body with some days of your upper body. You kill these workouts everyday and I can't keep my eyes off of you while I workout. I have wanted to talk to you for a while now but everytime I go try to find you your going home already. I think your beautiful and you have a body that shows your commitment to it and it is beautiful. I would love to talk to you and get to know you and i hope one day my timing will work out.

We make small talk and you "lost your locks" not long too ago. Please don't be shy and HMU if you see this (odds are probably less than 1%). You have a cute smile and it would be really great to hang out sometime and get to know each other... I'm so bad. I'm also the dude that asked you about how things are going in the KS "butcher-section"... We sometimes make jokes about it too. I loved the bit about the knives.

You have an amazingly sexy body and you looked fantastic in that orange blouse and jeans! I have dark brown hair with a little gray, 6'2, fit, good-looking wearing jeans and a light blue dress shirt. I should have said something :-(    


Jessica - m4w

Shot in the dark.  You gave me a fantastic massage like year ago and thought you knew me from somewhere. We exchanged a few cute texts after and I think you realized that I was interested in more.  I lost all the contacts on my phone and haven't seen any of your ads :-(  I am 45, fit, good looking, and work in the Tech Center. I have thought of you often and haven't had a massage in a year.

You wrote to me today - w4m

It had been a long time since I had heard from you. I'm sorry I stopped talking to you. I knew that if I did I would want to be more than friends. I find you incredibly sexy and talented and you were easy and fun to talk to. You will always be special to me. The times we shared were exciting and made me happy.  I often think about you. No hard feelings on my end. I hope you find what you're looking for.

You and I had a nice chat in the center dry sauna Sunday afternoon. You disappeared before I could get your number.    


You told me to slow down.. - w4m

Saw you when me and my daughter walked in to King Soopers in the produce section. Then again turning a corner of an aisle. You followed and yelled at me "hey slow down, I've been trying to catch you'... which did take me off guard, but I was on a mission to find something. I told you what it was and you helped me look.... didn't find it so I left without asking you why you were trying to catch me? Email me and tell me the item so I know it's you... would like to chat more...    


You crossed 20th and Larimer walking your dog... - m4w

I was in my car at the light. We had a few looks at each other. If by the most random chance you see this, say hello ;)


Rain...

I no longer chase you like I did, but I want you to know my love for you has changed, deepened, and grown. As I learn to love myself again, my love for you grows bigger, expanding to take the rest of my heart that was taken over by all the self-loathing and hatred I had. My love gets better as if you are here constantly, but you are not at all. My love for you has developed into feelings of more than just a deep friendship, it has become a chasm of wonderful feelings for you that I didn't have before. My seeming hatred and hurt is turning into dust blowing away in the desert wind. All that is left is the bare, exposed, weathered body yearning for your touch, your arms around my waist, your breath on my lips - just once. One dance, one night, one time together. To see that beautiful smile, just once, for now until we can meet when the situation finally changes and returns to "normal". I use these hopes as motivation. We don't chat or email anymore but when we do it's friendly, but I can feel your wanting to do this with me, too. I miss you like the deserts miss the rain... winter is coming...


Show off in Cheesman - m4m

You were wearing a white t-shirt and maroon shorts. Loved watching you show off.    


Arapahoe Kia service rep - m4m

You are so hot in your black Vans Redcap work pants.  Great looking too.  I'd love to meet and see if we hit it off.  Or we can just go right to me blowing you.


You're a Bills fan from Idaho - w4m

I gave you and your 2 friends a Lyft ride to Lakewood late Saturday night.


Starbucks - Peoria and E. 45th - m4w

You - A medium colored blue or black jacket, blue jeans, should length dark hair, slim build, average height (maybe 5'-6" or so)  at Starbucks this morning about 7:45 + or - 15 minutes.  You were by yourself.  You looked amazing and I got one of those 'we would click' feelings but was in a hurry and rushed out and on my way.  If you see this, please say hello.  It will save me from having to stop in every morning for the next two weeks hoping to see you again.    


"Missy" or "Misty?" from King Soopers - m4w

Saturday 10/8 - You were shopping for your daughter's birthday party. We spoke briefly in the bakery section while you were looking for gluten free items. You were so stunning that it took my breath away. It's a strange thing to say but I felt like I had known you all my life.

Starbucks Drive Thru - Hampden & 25 - w4m

You handed me my latte after watching me do my makeup in the drive thru.  You kept looking in my eyes.  It was pretty intense.  You were very hot!  


I LOVE YOU & I MISS YOU ARL - m4w

To my Beautifully, Stunning, Gorgeous Babe....I LOVE YOU & I MISS YOU more than any words in any language on earth could ever convey. Ive made many mistakes in our relationship. I am sorry for hurting you in every way over the three years we were together. YOU have been the absolute LOVE of my life. i miss YOU every minute of every day. No one will ever come close to replacing YOU in my heart and in my soul. God truly broke the mold when he created YOU. YOU are a one of a kind masterpiece that can never and will never be duplicated. 


My Umpire - w4m

We see each other often when you come by my work and while we flirt almost every time I can't get up the nerve to "make the first move" and call your bluff. Even when you make a point to always visit me no matter where I am. You are single but given the number of times you have mentioned your church I worry that you are likely just being friendly. I am married, and you know this, but what you don't know is that my husband approves of my crush on you. I have permission and I'd be happy to have the two of you talk to confirm that.


Snooze: Alone at the bar - m4w

You were sitting across from me this morning, red braids, glasses and a beanie. I just wanted to say that you are stunning. I'm usually pretty good at keeping to myself but I just couldn't keep my eyes off of you, even with your mouth full of breakfast burrito :)    


Front Porch "Impressive one" - m4w

You were there as a Duo.  One Black in white and the other was stunning. 


Miss you still boss - w4m

Doubt you will see this, I doubt you look here for me at all. I know in my heart that deep down you still think of me, even if only occasionally. Maybe only in your dreams, I know why you can never admit it.. I read the news-stay up on local current events, while listening to Pink Floyd, Ya, I wish you were here for sure  :(...and the sounds of my still broken heart weeping, all while smiling as though nothing were wrong.


Miss you still farm kid - w4m

Doubt you will see this, I doubt you look here for me at all. But even after all these years, I still miss you and think of u daily. I hope you are happy and it was worth it, but I know it's not. Someday you will see farm boy, but it will be to late. Truffles is your dream, you are mine... Glad I "hate" you some still

Damn it girl I took to long replying and the fucking flaggers flagged you . I just hope they burn in hell for their sinful flagging ways . Any way please reply to my post because to find someone with a little more to offer looking for someone with a little more to offer is harder than actually finding some one with a little more to offer . Thats me finding you looking for me , I just wish I had ten inches to offer you also . About 2" damn the honest thing , a little less then 3" shy of that one . But damn right being awsome like you I do know how to use it really REALLY well , and thanks to modern pharmicolagy <(?) Your damn right I last for more than 30 minutes

I was pumping gas around 8pm at 711 on wads worth and ralston by old town Arvada. You complimented my hair and I said thanks but I was too shy to ask if you needed a lift because I saw you walking.


I do lights for your building - m4w

I told you a few minutes ago you  looked very beautiful today after I thought I left my pen in your office. I was hoping you would say a little more and maybe give me a chance, but hope you see this and get back to me.    


Penguin - m4w

I love you so much Annie Jo. I hope that things are well, I will love you to my grave, that's what truly hurts. What might have been.


The tattered coat - m4m

Amazing how you can love someone so passionately at one point and how they can come to completely hate you later, but you can't bring yourself to feel the same way about them. Doing what was right then becomes a point of argument now, and the thought of being with someone forever back then now becomes your curse as you move forward. Separation makes you love or hate even worse, and the feelings become overwhelming.

I was behind you early this afternoon (13:00).  I don't want to think of you in sexual terms - because I think that I was sensing a whole lot more that is good, REALLY good.  I made a comment about something that you were wearing. If you are interested in any way, message me.  I would be thrilled if you saw this.

Visionworks - m4w

This is a long shot, but I saw you at Visions works at Colorado Mills Sunday the 9th around 2:30 p.m. You were there with your son trying on glasses. Your son was wearing a red shirt and you were dressed in black. I couldn't help but notice your kind smile and your happy, bubbly personality.  I thought I caught you look at me too.

i drove from denver to springs to see you (twice) - m4w

I drove to see you twice and you came here once. We had really good sex all three times. twice in the car near your work while you were on break. we spent months im'ing all night while we both worked and opened up to each other on very deep and personal levels. It was too intense for me at the time and i ran away scared. I'm sorry. I miss you and hope you will email me or text me. Hope you're good.    


My Koala Bear - m4w

I know that I treated you horribly. I didn't know what I was doing and I wish you would have just shown me your emotions. Instead you were just cold. If I could have seen your emotions I could have fixed myself. I know that the timing and everything was off and I guess it wasn't meant to be. I still miss you though. You were my home, my rock, the only thing I really cared about in life and I don't know how to let go. Please forgive me for everything I did because I was misguided by my friends and they, nor I actually saw the love I have for you. Hind sight is 20/20 but still the fact remains that I do love and care about you and always will. I know your not supposed to beg for love, but well the worst that can happen is you say no. I know you will not see this as your mind doesn't wander and you have focus, something you brought to me and I lost it. Anyways I miss you and I'll keep missing you. I hope your classes are going well.

You got some black and gold balloons filled up. I thought you were the most jaw-dropping, beautiful and sweet woman I've ever seen. I'd love to become friends with you.

Mon Chalet late last night - w4m

I was there with my husband and a friend. I really enjoyed watching you jack off while my husband and our friend F'd me. You were younger than me, but were clearly into me since you were watching me the whole time. You were there with a girl who seemed disinterested and she left but you stayed. I wish I would have invited you to join in but I was a little tipsy and didn't want to sound stupid when I talked to you. Tell me something specific that let's me know it's you. It's not too late for you to come over tonight!

X Bar on Oct 1st - w4w

You're friend told me that you thought i was cute. we kissed with passion in the parking lot of X Bar. Two women told us to follow them to their apartment.

At  the dog park earlier this afternoon - m4w

You came with your dog right as I was leaving this afternoon. You drove a silver car, had dark hair, and wearing darker clothes. My puppy wanted to say hi to you and when you turned around we made eye contact and said hey. Then we went on our separate ways. It's a long shot, but I'm new in town from Alaska and was wondering if you would like to meet up at the dog park sometime for a puppy date? My dog Kenai and I would like to meet some friends.


King Soopers Arvada - m4m

Friday afternoon around 4 pm.  We were in the bathroom at the urinals at the same time.  When I came out you smiled at me.  I was too stupid to say "hello."  You were wearing ND green shirt, I think.  Handsome man, please hit me back!  I want to meet you.

Overpowered by love - m4m

I try and say goodbye to protect myself but my heart never stops aching for you. I know you have moved on but I can't stop missing you. I just want this pain to go away. The fault lies in me. I try to steel myself but I am overpowered by my love for you. I almost wish we had never met. :(

Wish you came back to NJ- now you're engaged - m4w

Saw you got engaged this week. I know you've been with him for a while but I really am surprised. Part of me always thought you'd come back to NJ at some point and I really would've liked the chance to tell you how I feel. I think you already know and I think you felt the same way at some point. I'll do my best to feel happy for you...    


Just dogs

Sorry Dogs, you're barking up the wrong tree. You couldn't have watched me "jump from bed to bed". Not that it is any of your business, but I have slept with the same person since 1990. Now as for loyalty of the heart.... you may have something there. But that is a long story that is none of your business either.

I'm S and you're B... I picked you up in my Lyft at Rock Bottom by Park Meadows (your friend dropped you off) and I dropped you off near 12th and Humboldt. I'm an idiot for not asking for your number because you're a cool chica not to mention REALLY cute, and I'd like to get to know you better. :)    


With love from KC - w4m

We were together off and on / long distance for 6 years.  You once said you left the love of your life in Kansas City.  I think about you often. We no longer contact one another on our Birthdays because I didn't feel right because you are now married.  I will always love you.  You were my best friend and my everything. Life has been difficult without you and raising my son by myself.  I always said Things are meant to happen for a reason.   I gave you the best years of my life during my prime.  There were so many suitors and I waited for you, hoping that you would chose to be with me, but you never did. You once told me you felt bad for the way my life turned out.  I said it was ok, but it really wasn't.  Way down deep I was angry at you because I loved you more than anything and you hurt me more than anyone ever could.  This is my way of letting you know, even though I know you will never see this.  It's sad, but I am crying as I write this.  It has been over 11 years and I still think of you. I will never forget the time you called me after hearing the song "The Reason" by Hoobastank.  You were crying and told me how sorry you were and because of all the pain that you had caused me, it made you realize that you had to start over new.  I still can't listen to that song. If only the song would have been "It's not Over" by Daughtry.  Tonight I dedicate a song that you once dedicated to me by 3 Doors Down called "Here without You".  Happy Belated Birthday Dirty D.  I will always love you....

I'm jealous of the way... - m4w

I've fell in love with her twice and both times I was met with rejection. I'm not good enough to deserve her attention or her time. She lives life to the fullest and I apparently don't ... so I'm a waste of time. I'm not interesting and shoot maybe I'm just ugly? I never thought I wasn't good enough for her or that I was ugly but then I was rejected twice, by what I found to be the most beautiful lady I've ever met. 


You just sat next to me. - w4m

I'm sitting here waiting for a flight and a man sat next to me. He reminded me of you so much that I couldn't look at him. Painful. I will always miss you. He had his hair the same way you do yours. I hope you're okay.    


Autumn, just wish we could talk.... - m4w

I know you think I'm bat shit crazy. I'm not. I'm just fighting for what I believe in, which is you, us. I think it's ridiculous that you have held such a grudge against me over something that we could of worked on together. You make seem like I was cheating on you or something....I just lost myself, my thoughts, and my words and shouldn't of said what I said. But your lack of communication didn't help either. 


Just you

So in reading your post I wondered whether or not it may very well be just you. That is maybe It was just you who put these expectations upon you. I don't know just a thought as I believe my love felt this way even though I have always loved her just as she is.

Waterworks car wash - rain? - w4m

Hi John. I have never tried this before, but you've been on my mind since we met and we had a brief chat while waiting for our car wash. We thought it looked like it could rain but took the chance and washed our cars. You know my name and most likely the car I was driving. If you'd like to meet up again- reply with my name/car so I know it's you.    


Summer wedding in Winter Park - m4w

We just spent a week together, and every time you spoke to me, I was shaking in my boots. I kept talking about nothing, and you laughed at most of my dumb jokes. I liked your smiles, so I kept following you around hoping to see more of that. You eventually invited me to the house you were staying at one night, and I never showed up. I am pretty sure it was just so everyone could hang out, but I thought I saw a sparkle in you eyes that said something more. Maybe I missed my chance, but I can't stop thinking about you and your pigtails! I'm not sure who else you knew at the wedding. I've been hoping to track down your info, but I don't know if ll be able to. Maybe we will be able to share french fries again someday.

Gorgeous smile on Boulder Street - m4w

You were looking at your phone as you walked, seemingly using it to find your way somewhere along Boulder Street. I was strolling on the sidewalk, and slowed down in case you needed directions. But you just gave me the sweetest smile and kept walking. Seemed rude to try to get your attention again, but I'm still thinking about you.

Just my imagination? - w4m

I swear I can feel you thinking about me. Now it could be my imagination. But is it? We talked today. About the usual.  A couple moments of silence . but not akward. It was like neither one of us wanted to hang up. Could be my imagination. I can feel you whether you are in the same room or the other end of the city. Constant. Maybe my imagination? Do you feel my presence the same way?if so, Is it as strong as I feel yours? Or am I imagining. I know that when I ask you not to tell anyone anything I can confide In you without hesitation. Even though confidentiality is in your job description. Even though our paths are wound together they will be separating shortly. In a bittersweet way. Will this all stop once our business together is over? See you soon.


Getting a Mediterranean lunch - w4m

Wow. I was getting lunch today and you came and stood in line behind me. You're tall, broad shoulders and hot! I couldn't help turning around to sneak a peek. I was aggravated that the lady in front of me was trying to use a gift card that didn't work and kept me in line for 10 minutes before I could order. And finally when I got my food, you came and sat at the table I stopped at before walking out. I took another look and  by the time I drove off, I wished I had given you my card. I hope you see this...

We have history you and i, we once held each other at night with love in our hearts. We would watch anime smoke some bud and just lose ourselves in each other. We would have conversations that would last the night of we let it. We had a beautiful family together... But on that day when I got out of your to no longer hold you at night. To no longer watch anime and smoke some bud. To no longer have conversations that lasted forever. To no longer be apart of our beautiful family.... Time passed and I saw you where ever I went. I smelled your perfume from a place you just were. Then... I saw you with him and my heart sunk into my chest as if to never be seen again.... Then what I thought to be impossible happened... You contacted me out of the blue and all of a sudden my heart came back and everything seemed to be bright again. We talked and all I could do is smile and tear up from happiness. I thought to myself that this could be it.. You know.. When people say if it's ment to be they will come back... Well, I thought you were coming back... Then... You no longer talk to me and yet again I'm pulled into a darkness.....

My ex-boyfriend went back to ex-girlfriend - w4mw

Now I can say that I got my closure. After long wait finally someone who really decent told me the truth. My ex boyfriend went back to his ex girlfriend who cheated on him. I was so dumb to believe him. When I ask him are you still in love or communicating with your ex?  He will always say No! She cheated on me and treated me bad. I will never go back to her. All things he said he just ate. I'm as shock as everyone else. But I feel sorry for him. Rather I get mad at him I feel disgusted. But wish him luck and I forgive you.

I hate when men just leave a women with a child. There not men at all its most likely they were raised without a father.  Which is fine it gives me a chance to have an already made family.  Your small and petite, a laugh I could listen to all night.  I hope you see this and if not Im ready to make my move when I see you and your son.

Just wanted to let you know that you made my night/morning. If I see you again in there, coffee is on me!

Hailey,


Union Station Octopus - m4w

Yesterday morning, I was pondering the impact of my smoking habits on sea life while counting as many bic lighters as I could find on the octopus (47, by the way). You were a vision in a dress as blue as the sea, glasses glinting in the sun. My interest piqued as you described to your companion the reproductive habits of octopodes. I had no idea they were such devoted mothers, sacrificing themselves to care for their tens of thousands of unhatched offspring. Some note of empathy in your voice told me you'd make an incredible mother as well. I had to walk around back to the starfish to hide my erection once you launched into the impending effects of ocean acidification on marine life. So, to my lovely mermaiden, if you fancy a night of wine and raging about the devastating effects of anthropogenic climate change until the early morning, hit me back. I was the average-height man in the hand knit sweater.    


Sam's #3 - Saturday Night - m4w

Cute Smile Compliment from Cute Server - m4m

You work as a server at the Hard Rock Cafe on the 16th Street Mall. While you weren't our server, you brought our food. When I expressed that we would be sharing our food with my friend (who was young, blonde, pretty, and female), and that you could leave the food "anywhere," you made a joke about putting the plate on my head. I smiled and said: "Ha, that's cute." To which you replied something along the lines of: "Well, you have a cute smile." I was so taken aback that I could only look down and blush like some sort of pre-teen or something. Anyway, I've been thinking about that today quite a bit, and I thought I'd make a post in case you check these and were interested. I was wearing a short-sleeve, blue, buttoned shirt with dark blue jeans. I also have black hair and a "cute smile," too,  I suppose. Hit me up if you see this.

I thought you were super cute and you seemed really into me too. I was serious about our bet and I'm excited to pay up, as long as you don't mind if my husband joins in!

You and your gym partner were squatting. I and my gym partner were doing flyes. I don't stand out in a crowd so I'm sure you didn't even notice me. If I wasn't so shy and we were in a gym (I think it's rude to approach someone to chat them up when they're working out) maybe we could've talked. You probably won't see this and if you do you probably didn't see me. I was in a black t-shirt, grey shorts and grey Vans. I'm 6'3", lean, blonde hair and blue eyes. I'd love to grab a drink or a post workout smoothie or something with your sometime.    


J.J.  I have such a crush on you - w4m

J.J.  Is your initials.  I just have to throw out in the universe that I have such a crush on you !  There are so many times I want to act on it but I don't for a number of reasons.  I hold back.  Like today.  Which is a bummer because I think you may be flirting with me at times.  If your situation was different let me just say I would not hold back at all.   


My closure (our closure)

Today is one of those days that I can look within. I reviewed the past and now setting goals for the future. The truth is you do not exist in that future. Our past is just that. It was a hard lesson for me. I just waited and waited. I no longer wait and I will not ever. This is our goodbye.    


maryain I know I spelled you name wrong but - m4w

You were in all red and I regret not asking for your number. You are older then me but I think I would be worth it. tell me something about our conversation to show you are you.    


Specials shark shirt - m4w

You complimented me and I was with my mom so I couldn't quite talk as I wished, long shit but worth a try    


That's the spot

You know the spot. Where we. Wished the light was dimmer so we wncould be comfortable talking about private thoughts. You know the spot where the service is okay but we're too new to make a fuss. You know that spot where you make sure your smelling good so you'll be remembered. Ya, that's the spot. I miss you.    


I want something else......... - m4w




Dollar Tree - m4m

Saw you at Dollar Tree at Parker Rd and Dartmouth on Thursday afternoon, 9/29/16.  We checked each other out for a while.  You are a young hispanic guy wearing capri type pants and drove a gold colored car.  I'm a mature in-shape guy with S&P hair.  HMU and lets see what happens?    


Champs show gal photo colored hair - m4w

Your great smile jumped at me and I love our picture, together. Lets play again. Wholeheartedly because of the lights in your laughter.    


Physical - m4w

That was one of the best doctor appointments I've ever had. You are super cute and nice and maybe it was just me but it felt like there was some tension there. Thanks for your advice on the books and I don't think I'll be waiting so long before my next appointment. Thanks for the great start to the day and I hope you have a good one.    


Lady from London Platte River Grill - m4w

We met at The Platte River Grill on Wednesday evening this week... 9-28. I have long gray hair. I watched you talking with friends in a very animated way, then I heard your voice.  That was it. I am kicking myself for not at least trying to get your number....sooooooo...Can I have it now...? Thank you.    


Guilty pleasure - w4w

Her long, dark, brown hair cascading over her shoulders. Cinnamon toned skin with a sweet scent of Burberry; a meaningful soul. Both taken, both feeling the intense urge to satisfy one another. Entangled by her hatred towards me. It is indeed unmistakable. 


KC and the Sunshine Band - w4m

Your purdy lil SMILE! My inspiration sent to me from heaven up above. Lets take a pic. A tribute to your smile. Cheers!    


I think I could have loved you - m4w

It's almost as if fate itself doesn't want to give me a chance. I was married when you were single, I was divorced when you were engaged, and now we're both committed again. I don't know if it's just me, but whenever I'm around you I feel this intense tension between us, but we're both faithful people. We joke, we dance around the line, but never cross it. We keep things professional, but I swear I could love you, but I dont. I don't know you well enough to make that claim. But I think about it all the time. I think about how you might be out of your professional persona. The small glimpses I get from time to time of an interesting person I want to get to know more. I know we're both broken, but your the type of person that could build me back up, and i, you. But I'll never know for sure. I really think I could love you, but I dont.    


Pink Dress Bombshell, Starbucks on Belleview & Ulster - m4w

I was sitting at my table working on my laptop, when I look up and see an absolutely stunning blonde woman in a pink dress walking by me.  We lock eyes and exchange a smile, but before I could say anything, you are already walking out the door.   I saw you look back though as you exited, so figured I'd give this a shot.  It's a long shot of course, but that smile of yours is worth taking that long shot for. 


Jacking off in white truck on Santa Fe a couple weeks ago - m4m

I was driving in front of you and could see the motion of your arm although I wasn't quite sure? 


Our eyes met - m4w

September 29, you were sitting in the waiting room as I was retrieving my passport and we gazed at each other several times. I should have waited to introduce myself... I can't help but think about this chance encounter. Will we see each other again?    


CM - m4w

Your smile lights up the room. We're both attached but I can feel there is somthing between us. We would have to keep things discreet of course but I think we could have alot of fun. If you are interested reply with your first name and mine. I really hope this reaches you before the weekend ;)    


Korean Lady at H Mart - m4w

We met at H Mart and you helped me pick out some ground red pepper so I could make kimchee. You were so helpful and very sexy too. I would love to get coffee with you. Just mention the color shirt I was wearing so I know it is you. 


Louisville - m4w

To Anne,

At concert Thursday,  lost teal long down coat. Did anyone pick it up by mistake?


I can see clearly now - w4m

Hi "A", I don't know that you'll ever see this but, man! I am a customer where you work, though due to the nature of the business, I don't have to come in often.  Ok, so, I have a thing for redheads and your hair is particularly spectacular. You seem surprised that I noticed your haircut, but you really did look very nice. 


Logan Liquor - m4m

We were in the check out line Thursday evening.  You started the conversation (thanks!!!).  We talked about your friends that used to live in the area and that I used to live there, too.


whole foods denver west - m4m

You looked lost in the produce section.  We were crossing paths and exchanging glances, but didn't have a chance to connect.  I was just a bit too late to introduce myself in the parking lot.  I'd like to meet.  Drop me a line if you're interested    


I-25 and Hwy 85 Northbound - m4w

To the lady that kept looking at herself, on I-25 at 5:30, in your rear view mirror at her makeup. You look fine. I was in front of you for awhile. Hope were having a good day. What car were you driving?    


R--- We would have a good time! - w4w

I have know you for about 3 years now, and I would really like to know you better. Im a bit shy, so I never know how to communicate with you without sounding or feeling like a weirdo. I feel like we would enjoy each others company, as we have the same interests. We both have kids around the same age, and are both married. You make far more money than I do but that doesn't matter too me. I would hope that would'nt be a factor.

Attractive Guy in White Truck at Emmissions - m4m

I saw you and thought your were super attractive. I was bopping to my music in the emmissions line and you looked back and smiled at me. I kept looking at you and noticing how handsome you were! But I was too shy to talk to you. You spoke to me first and said "How long do emmissions take" I replied that it could take 15 to 35 minutes depending on who is in front of you. You were drive a white truck, you said it was really old... Like a 1987. I work for a dealership and I come to emmissions all the time. Hope to see you again! 


rose - m4w

We flirted at the check out stand you mentioned that us guys love to pull out too soon. Tell me where you work if it's you    


I'll wait forever - m4w

I'm not sure why I'm posting this, I suppose I'm searching for catharsis. Perhaps it's a way of grieving, putting my sorrow out for the world to heal.

Introspection - w4m

Funny how life works. Last week when the shift was happening I was a completely different person.  None of it mattered. When I looked at you, I saw a reflection of me, you do this, but in reality so do I. In a lot of ways that's true. Because of you I've seen myself in a whole new light. If I were a man I honestly don't think I'd date myself. I'm kind of an ass.

Flt from Houston to Denver - Wed Night - m4m

We were towards the back of the plane.  Sat in same row and I couldn't stop looking.  I am pretty sure you knew you were being looked at.  So handsome.   Would like to have talked you more.  I was able to assist you with something if you can mention then I know it was you.

Beautiful curvy blonde at Pepsi Center store - m4w

I was hanging out in the store at Pepsi Center today around 12:30 and noticed you browsing around. I tried not to stare. You were blonde, beautiful and voluptuous. Ended up standing right next to you at the register. It's a long shot with these ads but if you see this and noticed me too, email me. You're gorgeous :)

Looking for Charlie!! - m4m

I am looking for an old play friend by the name of Charlie! We use to have a great friendship. You and I Roleplayed all the time. We played for about 5 years and then lost touch. It's been well over 7 years ago since I last saw you. You came to my work a few times to get cleaned up. I would really like to catch up and maybe resume the relationship we both maybe wanted in the first place. So "Uncle Charlie" if your out there and remember me HMU. My name starts with a P.    


PRETTY ASIAN IN THE ELEVATOR - m4w

Chivalry is  not dead. You actually waited for my friend and I to catch up to you while you held the door for us. That was a nice change of pace. Then we ended up in the elevator together and you got off after one floor. I would've liked to have said something to you but it wouldn't have been appropriate at the time. I was carrying a helmet. Hit me up. You're  really cute and i didn't see a ring so?    


Your HOTNESS - w4m

I keep trying to catch a glimpse of you.  "Nothing beats Saturday"....agreed!! It was very exciting.  I hope another opportunity arises soon and that you'll act on it.

Looking for R. From W- long time, long shot - m4m

This is a long shot and we both beed to be very discreet but want to try to contact you. You've just moved back to the area, and since we knew each other back in school I thought you might need some help getting reacquainted with the area. If you just need someone to talk to.......    


Union Jack undies - m4m

I saw you Wednesday and Thursday in the locker room around 8:00 pm. You have a red robe and union jack undies. You're so cute and intriguing! Drop me a line if you want to chat more...    


RE:Glitter Globe - w4m

Which is it then? Glitter or Globe? Can only have one. May know why you say rock. You also have your self to blame I'm sure. Maybe you could have gone about some of it differently. Question why you where asked to wait then now you know why I'm sure. Not so easy to explain is it? Posting on CL dose not help. Once a long time ago it did help someone who is no longer with us. When some where told to be weary they where not. Couldn't catch up fast enough but I'm thankful that some finally did. You for the most part never make sense but we both know why. Lol You should really try talking you know the old dinosaur way. You may never know what could happen. Maybe it get you out of your nightmare mear I'm way too tired and busy to keep up with all these posts. Good luck on your posting.*^_^*

We chatted through e-mail about a year ago but lost your address. Hit me up if ur around and tell me something we chatted about if your interested.    


Lost your number!! We had a regular arrangement, I want to see you. - m4w

I won't put your name here, but we had an ongoing arrangement of me going down on you. I used to come over 3-4 times a month and take care of your needs... It was great for both of us. My phone died and all of my contacts from it were wiped out. I have the same number if you think this is you and want to just go ahead and text me. Or, respond here and we can confirm if it's you, or, if you are the woman that replaces her! You won't be disappointed.    


We were dancing - m4w

We were dancing close, and I turned you near the end of a song and my lips accidentally touched your neck. Sorry, I wasn't trying to kiss, but I did enjoy dancing with you :)

It quickly turned to kissing and me touching you elsewhere but we hadn't gone further. I lost your emails and still think of you and wish we could connect. If you see this email me and let's talk    


Planet Fitness DT 4PM - m4m

You're often working out the same time as me around 4-5PM and you always look great. You have a fair complexion and may be latino? Today you wore a sleeveless red shirt, white shorts, and reddish shoes. I had on a gray hat. Sometimes you work out with a male and female friend, and I'm guess you're in your early/mid20s. If you see this, let's chat =)

Anyone know Gail Jones?

I live in California, & lost contact with a good friend who I used to work with at St. Paul Insurance Company.  She worked in our Boston Ma office. If anyone knows her, please let her know that an old friend (Anthony G.) would like to hear from her.  She's an African American lady, should be in her early 50s.    


Asian in Costco

You were there around 3, with your husband an child. You are pregnant maybe a few months.! I'm wondering if you noticed me as you reached to grab eggs? Then on the way out you were cleaning your child's face,  did you know I could see everything? I don't think you had in any underwear? Your husband was white an looked pretty lame you had Florida plates on N Infiniti SUV.. you were tiny an sexy!

We stood next to ea other for a while this afternoon watching ea JO. I love your cock and it felt great in my hand, I also loved how you rubbed your finger across my head and peeled my 4skin back to see the head. Your a very handsome black guy and I was the older white male, I think both about the same height. Anyway I hope you see this because I would love to meet up again and see that beautiful cock of yours blow a load. Give me a shout.


Lily- you work in Wakefield, and the more I see you, the more I..... - m4w

Want you. I can't believe how incredibly sexy you are. I see you a few times a week, and every time I find you to be more attractive, or notice something about you I haven't noticed yet. I can't say anything. It couldn't be more inappropriate a situation for anything to happen.... But wow do I want it to. And, if you ever would consider it- I would start in an instant. I'm a bit older than you, and I wouldn't imagine a girl as beautiful as you could be single.... But as you know, neither am I. Which wouldn't make it easy, but I'd do anything, for.... Well, something.    


Bagel world you were leaving as I was coming in, cute... - m4w

I wish I had been thinking quicker, because I should have introduced myself to you as your new sugar daddy! You were very cute, we smiled at each other as we passed.... And I wish you were on the menu there, because I would definitely pay to eat you anytime ;)    


Looking for Jessica or Jess from Lynn. 20s, brunette, cute - m4w

I miss my Asian top in Lynn - m4m

We met off and on for a number of years.  I really enjoyed what we had going, I knew I was just your bottom chub bitch and it was not meant to be serious or last forever, but I can't help but miss it.  I thoroughly enjoyed bottoming for you, pleasing you.  I wish we could have kept it up but alas you want no more of me and have moved on and have told me to find someone elsewhere and move on but haven't found anyone and not interested in anyone else.  I felt comfortable with you and safe bottoming for you.  I may have pushed you away with the pestering.  But alas, things don't last forever, but am happy that you have found what you are looking for.  I still hope that someday I could bottom for you again.    


D'Angelos today at Noon - m4w

Went to grab my sandwich today at lunch.  You were ahead of me in line and then when I went out to the parking lot, your car was next to mine.  I know this is a long shot but your a hottie!  I'd love to chat and meet up!    


Beautiful in the Day - w4mw

I was walking around yesterday and saw you with a curious instrument in a beautiful case - maybe a lute or a sitar?  You smiled at my obviously astonished face gaping at you like a child.  My mind whorled and somewhere within it I played out a fantasy where you opened the case and played a song right there..... the streetsounds of Boston fading into the background.....

Want to be missed connections? - m4w

Just wondering if you'd like to be missed connections? Are you one of those people that had the "feeling" but didn't act and post?   I'm a married man, but isn't that what the missed connections are all about, a married man and woman meeting online for that rush of excitement? Would you like to get to know me online and offline?


Blond guy with the red shorts - m4m

you work out regularly at one of the BSCs on the northshore. I see you a couple of times each week. You are younger than me. I love the tall smooth blond type like you.  I think you were being a little bit of a tease this morning on the gym floor coming over to where I was working out


Orange line, green shirt, hat - m4w

You were riding the orange line yesterday when your child dropped his cup. I picked it up for you. Find you quite attractive. If you're up for some fun, message me.

Cute Guy that walks by my job in the morning. - m4m

Cute guy dressed in black walking by my job in the early morning hours.  Smiling at me today.   Beautiful smile.   I never know when your going to be there but wish I could wipe the serious look off my face and back in a way that doesn't look so cheezy or forced.  Not really an all teeth instant smile person.  My feelings work a little slower.  


I miss my Ecstasy girl - m4w

It appears she has moved away and now I am lost. I would love to find another. She was a lot of fun and a great companion, but I also realize her education must come first. I have the time and what it takes to be a good friend. Young woman like to explore and I like to instruct. Always with kindness and respect. If you do want to answer this add please add in the heading Ecstasy girl found.  Thank you kindly  Dad.

Green Line yesterday - same guy - m4m

Ok, I posted something on Tuesday from my morning commute. Sure enough I saw you again yesterday, this time on an E train going outbound a bit before 9. You got off at Arlington both times (so it makes sense you'd be on any green line train). This time we were on a more crowded train standing at opposite ends of the car, but I'm pretty sure you saw me and noticed me again. You're very handsome and you were wearing the same jacket both days. I was hoping for a hat trick this morning but I didn't see  you. Really hoping you see this or that I see you again. What color was your jacket, and what else can you tell me about yourself?

Thanks for making the sauna commute a little more bearable.  Juding by the fact you got on right after I had given up my seat (I'm guessing Broadway?), would you like to grab a drink near work sometime?  After all, we've already fogged up windows.

Rick from upton - m4m

We were both at the bar sitting near each other watching the game a few weeks back.  We started chatting, you had a lot to drink, told me that you were going through a divorce.  By end of night, i suggested we come to my place for a few drinks.  You said yes... I ended up making a move and having you.   After I made you cum hard you got up and left fast.  I know its a longshot but I keep thinking about you and your cock.  You were a young stud. If by some chance you see these, email me and tell me either bar we were at or where my house was.  Love to get you to cum again so bad.  Can still feel your load    


I told you that I love you - m4w

I wish I had a chance to dance with you, or even just talk for a minute.


It was written - w4w

I can't help myself when it comes to you.  You are beautiful.  You are electrifying.   And I'm yours.  In hindsight, falling for you was inevitable.  Come closer, let me love you.


A broken globe on a shelf is not meant to be touched. - w4mw (all that - m4w

Miss broken globe, it sounds like you have had experience investing in the wrong man. Maybe you both were broken.    


A broken globe on a shelf is not meant to be touched. - w4mw

It will make your hands bleed if you pick it up and try to fix it. No matter how much you want to fix the cracks. Be really careful who you invest your love and care into, a lot of times, it isn't appreciated or even wanted. I am not anyone's intended, just want to warn other women who might be tempted to love someone, who has hurt them deeply. Love is a gift.    


re: glitter globe heart - w4m (with you once in a blizzard) - m4w

To all who have responded: This event did not happen on New Year's Eve, and there was no power loss. It did not take place in Carver, or in East Brookfield. There is no connection to a class ring either. But, thanks for the response ladies. Much appreciated.

420 to nurse while young lady strokes me - m4w

This ad is a little different, but I'm 100% real and very sincere in my desire. I'm seeking a woman who would be interested in "adult nursing". I'm not looking for sex or anything additional than nursing. I'm not necessarily looking for friendship or any deep bond, though I would not rule that out either. Having been an only child while being given zero physical affection, it's something that I deeply crave. I will suckle or "nurse" on your breasts and receive a deep-seeded need for that type of affection and you can fulfill deep maternal instincts (if you are into this type of arrangement).

Wednesday 10/12 at BSC Fenway - m4m

You were nice enough to move your barbell while deadlifting--I helped you. You're extremely handsome, obviously a strong lifter, and possibly queer--we left the gym at the same time and I'm curious to see you again!

Don't know how to explain it. I can normally talk to you, but only regular conversations, I don't have the courage to ask you out. Maybe I should but I'd rather not feel stupid after

Stairwell at the annual International Congress of Anarchists (ICA) - m4w

So there I was, slouching in my seat in the packed auditorium at the convention center, half listening to an august invited anarchist give a talk ("Making Subversion Part of Your Everyday Life") and sipping tepid, capitalist coffee when you came and sat down next to me.  You were slim, and wore black low-top Converse Chucks, black jeans, and a black sweater.  The black accentuated your pale complexion and your magnificent shoulder-length red hair.  I had never seen someone so beautiful.  I began to daydream that I was living with you in a mud-and-stick hut in a forest after the collapse of civilization.  I imagined that we ecstatically tried every one of the positions in the Kama Sutra.  I was startled out of my reverie when you leaned over and whispered to me: "This talk is so boring."  We began to whisper back and forth.  You took my hand and led me out of the auditorium in the middle of the talk.  We passed through endless empty labyrinthine corridors and eventually we ended up in a malodorous stairwell in a far corner of the building.  It was quiet, and the light was feeble and sickly yellow.  I was fairly certain the smell was that of urine.  "Fuck this place," you said, scrawling an anarchy symbol on the wall with a black sharpie.  "Yeah, fuck it," I said.  We sat down on a step, kissed, shared a joint, and kissed some more.  I was in love.

BBW's Rock!!  Seeking on-going FWB - m4w

Hello! I'm a clean (D&D free), handsome, professional white male.. very fit, uninhibited, and playful. I seek one genuine, intelligent, equally uninhibited and playful classy brunette who can host weekdays, for friendship and discreet (yes, discreet.. you know what that means) sensual play. The woman I seek is not a player.. but rather a bit unsure of this whole CL venue. She seeks the safety, secrecy and sensuality of a married man for her own reasons. 


I want you

I am tired of hiding who I am and what I feel. I'm losing the will to maintain a level of social character. God darn it, I want to be able to tell you who I am and know once and all what that means to you and for you. 


Sigh

I wrote a whole bunch of shit that doesn't matter, yet again. I am pathetic, just sorry. Jeezus, when will I wake up and face reality because I am tired of drowning in your eyes. Really it wouldn't be so bad if the reality of the situation was that you were teaching me to swim, or at the very least sending me some life saving inner tube.

Offered to transport your lumber for you - m4m

Wednesday afternoon we were both shopping and checked out around the same time. When we got to the parking lot we were parked next to each other. I kept checking you out as you were making room for your items in your van. I think you saw me checking you out and I said hi. I asked if you lived near the store and wanted help transporting your wood. You politely declined but still told me where you live. In case you are interested and see this I wanted to help you with more than the wood you bought. Let's get together and help each other.    


Main St Video Last Tuesday Night (10/4) - m4m

AWESOME, AWESOME COCK,


Your ad was titled NOT SATISFIED AT ALL before getting flagged - m4w

You posted an ad titled NOT SATISFIED AT ALL under the Boston South Shore casual encounter section. You are 50, 5'2" and have a boyfriend but you said that he doesn't satisfy you and that he is very small. I was about to reply to your ad when some asshole flagged it and I couldn't send my response thru. I am 55, with someone who doesn't satisfy me and also live in the South Shore. If you happen to see this, please reply, I found your ad very intriguing and I am very interested.    


Blonde girl in AMs at Beverly YMCA - m4w

I probably could have gone forever thinking to myself just how beautiful you are -- blonde hair always pulled back, stretchy black yoga pants revealing your beautiful curvy butt, bright neon colored workout tops that also nicely reveal your beautiful curvy breasts, clear skin, pretty smile -- and simply kept my mouth shut about it all.  However, one day when you were close to me, I don't know if it was your shampoo, or body wash or lotion, but something about you smelled SOOO sexy that it nearly brought me to my knees!!  Ever since that day I haven't been the same!  I now find myself looking for you in the mornings, and get discouraged when I don't see you!  But when I do see you I fail to say anything because I don't want to bother you.  I'm (probably much) older than you and for all I know you think I'm just a tool.    If you think this sounds like you and you know who I am, write back and tell me what exercise I was doing today near you    


You held the door for me at the bank - m4m

You looked to be a couple of years younger than me and just out of work. I was walking out as you were coming in. You stopped and held the door for me and gave me a sexy smile. I was still in the parking lot when you left and we made a lot of eye contact as you walked to your car. Hope you see this and get back to me with some details. We can keep it discreet.    


I took your coffee. - m4w

We were in the Starbucks, the one on Wayside rd. It was busy. You ordered a grande iced, and when they put it out on the bar, I mistook it for my decaf. I realized that it wasn't mine when I walked outside, took a sip, and got a mouthful of metallic sweetener. Was like licking an I-beam. And I'd know. You must have a palate like the ass-end of a cow, because that was nasty. Put it under the wheel of my car and drove over it and away.


RE:To my best friend who has decided not to speak to me. - w4m - w4m

Maybe you should hang out with and text your husband. You're way too hard to be friends with. Too many rules about when and how often I have to talk to you. You lose your shit if I don't talk to you for a few days, you cyber stalk me and criticize people I might be friends with. You're far from being in any position to be that critical of anyone.

I was standing behind you at the CVS Pharmacy at Stadium Plaza in Tewksbury. You were wearing a Red Sox baseball cap and I was too. You have salt and pepper hair and light blue eyes between 5 ft 10 and 6ft tall mid forties to maybe early 50s. We both smiled at each other and when it was my turn to get my prescription you looked back and we smiled at each other and then you were gone. I was instantly attracted to you and I am hoping that you will see this post and contact me.

We met over a month ago during a meeting that was held at a Mexican restaurant. You were confident, and I enjoyed talking with you afterward. You wanted my advice on a few computer programs.

There is nothing special I would drop everything to come running to.  I got to hear another woman ask you about Riding. This only confirmed everything I believed. So, thank you.  Your letter was pathetic especially compared to the texts the day before filled with all your lies and promises of making me happy.  You tricked me. Once you get my dowry it will be good bye.  A day in my life with you.  No more days like that for me. You have left me to my own devices for to long. Our story is over and im not sad mad angry. I'm done. Hope you feel better buddy.

Your little Asian friend. :-) PS thanks for introducing me to the term "heteroflexible".

I feel a little weird posting here, but I figured it might be worth a shot. We sat at the corner of the bar in the back room and watched the presentation on mosquitoes.

Name the blizzard. Something happened that day, a rather unfortunate turn of events that complicated my situation. Something only you would know if this is who I think it is.    


Forgive but not forget

You took your post down, the one you posted at 9:09 and edited at 9:10.


Anyone know Sophia aka Alec James - m4w

Did anyone get an email from a Sophia who says she lost a bet and will do anything that the person thinks of. She says she is in college, lives near beacon hill. She has sent pics. I have been chatting with her, just want to see if she is real and if anyone else got an email from her. Has the "to good to be true" feeling but you always need to see where it goes.


Wondering how you are LH - m4w

Been a very, very long time now L. After all these years, came across a pic of you and myself and wondered what ever became of you. 


Shana - m4w

Monday at twin river. Black Jack table, second floor. Horrible place to ask for a phone number. This is a hail mary.

I honestly don't know how you do it. - m4w

You seem so well put together. 


Pointing south - m4w

I just wanted to thank you for that brief moment of pleasure when I saw you come around the corner and our eyes met. 


Was there something else you wanted to say to me? - m4w

You know... when that door opens, it's a surprise for both of us. 


Hot Blonde Hair Dresser At Pro Cuts - m4w

Pro Cuts Bridgewater Wednesday evening. You gave me a high N tight hair cut and I told you it was perfect and you gave me a card with your scheduled weekly hours. You were about 5'6" blonde, curvy and had a pink lips tattoo on your forearm.

We sat next to each other on the flight and then you were ahead in the taxi line and kept looking back. I was going to offer to take you wherever you were going. Not sure how long you are in Boston for.    


s.o.s. to my sherlock

I think my dad disowned us, and that's why things remained more blurry. Been one with the other orphans of battle, if you will, to the extent of practictal anesia, which beckons the question, am I jesus, or am I the DEVIL? A hallmark of black and white thinking and transient stress related symptoms of disassociation. It's not the drugs and it's not the people I would warn others of....it's self decided actions employed both selfishly and cruelly while the owner takes no ownerage of anything that results in decreased happiness and usually ends with non self decided actions to bid for political seats or attempt to become god. This is a power play as the person with that power to affect so many lives prior now has to figure out a way to get it back. Since it's a way and not the way, the person exalts that newly paved path as the way or as something exponentially important or crucial or deliriously evil as worthy of idol worship.


Nordstrom Boylston Street - m4m

Ran into you this morning in Nordstrom. I told you that you looked like someone I knew that worked on a certain street. Hit me up.

Looking for Sandy from the south shore.  You and I exchanged a number of emails over the summer. I was looking for someone who wanted get a very specific and limited type of massage.

Natick Mall - Brookstone (Russian Accent) - m4w

I'm probably reading to much into this but...please contact me if this was you and you were more then being a salesperson.

"turkey on the dance floor" - m4w

I used to make you laugh singing the wrong words to songs... or just tickling you until out of breath..  I really wish I could have made you happy all the time, but I couldn't...   You will always be cemented into my heart.  I just don't know if love will ever fill my heart like when I had you in my arms.   


Kate - m4w

I am fairly sure that's not your real name. I think I'm starting to remember why it's been so long. Because saying goodbye to you seems to rend my heart. And I'm pretty sure that's not how this is supposed to go.

I was having dinner at Tavern in the Square tonight with my family for my birthday and you were our waitress.  You had a tattoo on your wrist and you had long brown hair. I thought you were very friendly and super cute! I didn't want to be that guy that leaves his number on the receipt, but not sure if this is any better.  If you read this, it would be great to hear from you.    


I work with your wife - w4m

I am married too, maybe if the situation were different - but for now its just fantasy.


3 guys at GSpa tonight

You were three guys from Boston at GSpa tonight.  One looked Middle Eastern, one was Black or Hispanic and the last one was white.  You were in a rush to drive back home because you were riding motorcycles.  You all were so hot and I would have serviced all of you.  Tell me what the Black or Hispanic Guy had on his back and what the White guy was wearing in the hot tub and we'll talk.  I think you decided to hang at the casino until the rain stopped.

Nutrition Student on the T - m4m

We met waiting for the bus at Davis last week. You were looking to get into Medford and asked for directions. You said you were a nutrition student in town and was surprised that I wasn't a student too. We got on the same bus, but it didn't occur to me until afterwards that there was a slight flirting there and that I should have continued the conversation. I'd love to grab a drink sometime, maybe be your tour guide too!

Matt, You Transferred to Littleton - m4m

Back in May you trained at the building I work in.  You had introduced yourself to me one day when you came over to ask the trainer, who sat near me, a question.  You seemed like a real nice guy, and I thought you were very handsome.  I was disappointed when I found out you were transferring to the new building.   You've been on my mind ever since then.  Anyway, these 'missed connections' posts are always a long shot, but I had to give it a shot.  If you see this and are also interested in getting together, please let me know.  Thanks.

This morning I stopped to let you cross the street to get your mail.  You are a stunning blonde and I very much wanted to say something, but I feared you would think it was creepy.

Anyway, in the very off chance that you see this and had similar thoughts, life is short so take a chance.  Tell me what sports team apparel you were wearing so I know it is you.

I've banged my head against every wall I can find. Run until I can't breathe; can barely walk. Cried until I exhaust myself; or shame myself for being such a baby. And why? After all this time, somehow, it's You. 


Chubby bearded guy at Taco Bell - w4m

I saw you a couple of weeks ago when you walked into Taco Bell. You were wearing a black hat and glasses and had tattoos on your arms. I have a thing for high-pitched voices so when you started talking I got tingles all over my body. You paid for your order with a giftcard and argued that it used to only cost you $10.78. You got your order and walked out to your car where you downed your food in mere seconds, like a predator devouring its prey. I had to keep myself from licking the window as I watched the hot sauce dripping down your glistening chin. I've never wanted to be a napkin so much as in that moment. I can't stop thinking about you and I've gone back to that Taco Bell and sat in the parking lot every week awaiting your return, but you never came back. If you happen to come across this, please message me. I would love for you to go to town on my taco ;)

Samantha Cotter ? - m4w

I was at the registry of motor vehicles, Standing behind the teller that was helping you. when I heard a man swearing, I turned around and was instantly struck by how beautiful you are, standing there with your glasses on, you started to talk to the teller so kindly  about how she puts up with these kind of guys then you said "I don't like aggressive guys". I briefly shared a few words with you, but I didn't want to interupt you and the teller. I was hoping that you would be finished with the teller before I left so that I could talk to you without getting in the way of what you were doing. Unfortunately I finished first and left before I had the opportunity to talk to you. Ive never done anything like this before, so I hope that this finds you, and doesn't creep you out. I just really wanted a chance to get to know you better. :)

Rachel, 


E, you screwed us over, not me - w4m

You can keep on hating me if it makes you feel better, but you're the one that fucked up, not me. You should have told me you gave a shit about us because it sure wasn't apparent from your apathy. You need to learn to express your feelings...I'm not a mind reader, nor is anybody else. You're the one who just didn't care, not me. I tried everything. Bye. I hate you for not caring.    


re: thinking of you often - w4w

I am proud of you. As the Jewish philosopher says, "you can be whoever you want, even yourself." But I'm not content. I want more. More than the gods have given me. I'm greedy.

E Line Rush Hour - w4m

I've seen you on the E Line once before from Park Street to Symphony, thought I felt you looking at me today during rush hour. You were sitting in a single seat, wearing glasses. At one point you took off your headphone to listen to what I was saying to the man in front of you. I'm a tall brunette, you're a very tall guy, send me a description if you think this is you!    


a female version of me - m4w

I've never been a guy who's good with words.  At best I've been the guy who likes to think he is, until the moment it comes to write something.  The tyranny of the blank page, I've called it.  So I don't know why I'm writing now, but sometimes, it's the thing to do.

Elucidation desired - w4m

How does one justify summarily excising a supposedly beloved and certainly well proven friend from their life? I've sat with this question for a number of weeks now and the only conclusion I'm able to reach is that I mattered but very little to you all along. Is it cruelty or cowardice or convenience that drives such callousness?

This is way beyond a long shot but I thought I'd at least try. You asked me something in line, if you remember please tell me what it was    


we work in the same office - m4m

Not sure you will ever see this, but I wanted to try.  We work in the same office (not together).  I saw you pop up on Grindr the other day but not sure if I should reach out.  Anyway, hit me up if you think this is for you, and we can see if there is a connection beyond the eye contact :-)

to the genius scientist who has my heart. - m4w

Thirteen years ago, I became smitten with you. It didn't take much, as you well know. You're one of the most brilliant and vibrant people I have ever had in my life. Once, years ago, I lectured you about love and how you were too young at the time to know anything about it - you responded so comprehensively that I was full of shit. You defended yourself and your feelings - something a person should never have to do - and I swore that I would never accuse you of that again. In fact, I stopped lecturing you altogether.


Nice Sweater Salem. - m4w

I lost something and was looking for it. You said "nice sweater to me", I said thanks and kept looking for it.  You were very pretty, I felt stupid a few minutes later.

Nice to hear your voice - m4w

I didn't expect to get you on the other end when I called yesterday. It was a pleasant surprise nonetheless :)


re: really sad

People can do whatever they want. If you don't like it  don't partake in it. 


my voice - m4w

You complimented it my voice by telling me you loved it. I couldn't help but think about you ever since then. Just in case, where did you see me? What was the last thing you said to me? If by any chance you see this, contact me and maybe perhaps we could get together and talk. Up to you.    


Your spirit tho... - w4w

I think about you often. That never stopped. I guess I'll always love you. God I loved you! Letting you go was painful. I've never loved another like I had you. Came close once but when she said she would end up with a man later in life, I knew to let go. It's the things great and small that we pay attention to in order to avoid further heart ache. I paid attention with you as well. It's been many years now. You'd probably laugh at me now for this limerence I'm left with, think foolish of me, or pathetic. I am a pathetic fool hearted individual. I'm in a place I don't belong where true love exists only for a few, and it's pure luck. Love is a curse for the rest of us. It's not that many of us don't have it figured out. It's simply the luck of the draw. I've been very unlucky. My biggest misfortune in love was that our paths crossed and I wasn't able to accept you where you were. I couldn't handle the drinking all the time and I wanted you healthy and wanting better for yourself and for us. So much more than drunken weekends and week nights. I don't like that. I can't trust what I have when it's that clouded. Then there were the lies. I didn't want to be lied to. I didn't want to mistrust your intentions or question them. It was a difficult time. I loved you tho, purely. I wanted you healthy and honest. I couldn't believe in you the way you were; a drunk and a liar. I hated that behavior. I still miss you tho, the spirit of you, your energy, our communion. I've had many others in the years following. Fruitless ventures. I don't regret letting go as I would have grown only to hate you for your shortcomings. I'm just not one of the lucky ones. I'm healthy and evolved, just very unfortunate in the area of love. I know I'm not alone. I don't feel alone. I do however feel your absence. I hope you're healthy and well.

Every day love - m4w

You are my wife.  You are the most beautiful and wonderful person I know.  I can never seem to tell you exactly how I feel.  I was hurt so many times before you swept me up and loved me so beautifully.  Every day I feel more and more able to show you.  I think of you every day.  I dream of all the days I will get to bring you coffee in bed, when we can chat or read aside one another as we start the day.  Maybe someday we will expand our family?  Either way, honestly, you fill my life with joy.  You inspire me with purpose to grow and love you more and more.  I am better because of you.  I stumble over my words when I talk to you - even now.  And you must think I don't have much of a romantic side.  You look at me so lovingly and all I want to do is pick you up in my arms and swirl up into the air until we reach the moon and kiss you and caress your back so gently it tickles and hold you until you sleep peacefully.

Cutest Runner At The Gym - m4w

We were at the gym today and I noticed you in the mirror behind me.  You were running on the treadmill and I was using the elliptical.  Not only was I impressed with your pace, but also with your physique.  You had on grey yoga pants and a t-shirt which covered your backside most of the time, although every now and again you would hike up your shirt and catch my attention.  Over the course of 45 minutes we made eye contact multiple times, and then again afterwards while stretching on the mats.  If you could tell me which gym we were at, I'd love to talk...maybe we can go for a run :)    


Bryant Park - m4w

I can't believe I did not say hello to you. After locking eyes with you a few times, you walked right past me with your friend as you were leaving and I choked. You're gorgeous. Hopefully I will see you again and redeem myself by sacking up and saying hi.

Around 10:30 last night, I was walking north on 1st Ave and somehow your afghan shawl reached out and grabbed me by one of the buttons on my cardigan.

UptownTimes Square 2/3 Express Blue Suit Jacket Bodybuilder - m4m

You- Wearing a tight (probably had no choice, because your body/chest, was just bursting out!) Blue suit jacket on a crowded uptown 2/3 Express, around 5-5:30.  Me- glanced over to you and you looked back. When the train pulled into 72nd. St. I moved over to you. Man you have some body! And yes, I got hard. I'm getting hard just recalling that. We exchanged glances quite a few times. I was wearing a dark blue jacket and had a black bag with me. We got off (no pun intended!) at 96th. St. but unfortunately I was going the opposite way. I'm a real gentleman and would like to have some man to man/muscle worship contact and more with you.  I don't know if you'll read this, but if you do, I hope you consider it because I know we'll have a great time!

This posting is for the sexy Asian woman I saw on the N train yesterday 10/12 around 9:30am. I'm the 32 year old white guy with light brown hair, green eyes, handsome, and tall 6'2. I was wearing the dark blue suit and was on my way to a meeting at work. I noticed you had gotten on the N train at union square. You were wearing a really short white miniskirt (very similar style to the pic I posted but as I said yours was white) and black heels with a black tank top, you looked so sexy, in fact when you sat across from me you and crossed your legs, I noticed you weren't wearing any panties and I got a glimpse of your shaved pussy. my cock got so hard just seeing that, as my stop at times square was approaching I went to the door by where you were sitting. As I looked at my phone for a minute, I looked up and you were smiling right at me. I smiled and looked away and I was getting off you looked and smiled again at me and I should have talked to you because you were really hot. I'll admit I've been fantasizng about having hot sex with you since I've been at work. Maybe if you're reading this we can exchange some pics and maybe meet up for a drink and have some fun. Would love to hear from you, or any other sexy asian women :)

Miss you Kate - m4w

It's been several months since I heard from you last, but I miss you terribly. Whatever we were doing, I enjoyed it greatly. I'd be happy being any part of your life. Whether it's someone you can talk to or confide in when you don't know where else to turn. I'd be ok with being your little secret friend that nobody would ever have to know about. 


Amnesty Canvasser Who Took Me By The Hand - m4w

You smiled and held out your hand as I was rushing down St. Mark's Place Wednesday morning. When I found out you were canvassing to help refugees, I was smitten. You had long dark hair and were wearing a jacket. I have short-ish blond hair, blue eyes, and was wearing a black t shirt.

Last night, was driving past a loft located at 330 Ellery and saw you hanging out with your friends. We made eye contact and I wanted to approach you but was kind of intimidated by you being in a group. You were hanging out next to a pick up truck w/florida license plates.  I had on a white tank top and an indian aqua print knee length skirt.

Hey dude, You and I had a few stare downs on the Queens bound Q train today.  I'm the black guy with the brown hair braided back. In a blue button down with a dark blue trench coat. You also had on a light blue button down, with a dark blue sweater vest.  We kept making eye contact, either I would catch you staring at me or you would catch me staring at you. You got off at Queensboro plaza. You looked as if you were pretty in to me. I would never normally do this and there's a pretty good chance youll never see this, but you're hot and if you're down to meet up for a beer or two please reply to this.

I thought I would see you again - w4m

We met last week in a class at work and talked briefly afterwards. I wanted to ask you to have dinner with me but didn't want to seem like a creep. I thought I could talk to you the next day but you weren't in class. I keep thinking about you and wonder what would have happened if I had asked you.    


To the Asian girl who looked at me in a green cab - m4w

You are gorgeous. Tall and slender. I was headed downtown on Lexington in a green cab with another passenger. You turned to look at me twice. I should have smiled but got nervous.  Let's grab coffee or dinner.

Cute guy on delayed Astoria bound N, afternoon 10-13 - m4m

I'm...sort of surprised I'm posting this, pretty out of character for me, but I feel like it's worth a shot? You were a handsome darker haired guy with glasses and a tie sitting on the Astoria-bound N when I got on at Times Square. I was the blond guy in the grey jacket and purple shirt. We exchanged a couple glances, and you were really cute when smiled at the little girl that got on. When we hit Queensboro the train announced it would be running express to Astoria Blvd and as much as I wanted to stay on, I had to get off and catch the next train, but not before we passed a couple smiles as the train pulled away.

Handsome man at Walgreens on Bidwell - w4m

I saw you smile and look at me with a lingering look while we were both shopping at Walgreens Friday about 4pm. You were tall, with dark brown hair and beard and a dark blue tshirt. I thought you were so handsome. I noticed you didn't have a ring on. You were at your car doing something in the back end of your white Subaru when I came out. We looked at one another again and I smiled. Then I left and you watched me leave and looked for me driving by, watching me the whole way. I wanted to come back and say hi, I don't know why you didn't ask me out, but I have been thinking about you since Friday and if you happen to find this... we both need to stop being so shy.

I looked up a few times and we made eye contact, and smiled.

You grew up in Skyview. Might be nice to meet up, Chris (you told me your name and asked for mine). If interested  feel free to respond.

You were sitting two booths down from me at lunch today. I probably should have just talked to you like a normal human being but I had just flicked ginger sauce all over my shirt and, well, that's no way to meet. I thought you were really pretty and would love to sit at your booth one day.

We were both a flight from LHR to JFK. We spoke whilst waiting to board the flight but then were on opposite sides of the plane and did not talk during the flight. I looked for you after clearing immigration to give you my business card but I think you had already left. Would love to touch base and perhaps meet for a drink the next time we are in one of the various cities we travel to. If by some miracle you see this, send me a message with who I work for or what I do/where I live.

I never post here on Craigslist but just had to today after the sexy big ass Latina I saw on my way to work, Friday September 30th. I was walking to the F train at 7th ave and you had just walked out of a deli and you were so hot. You were wearing tight black pants (similar to the pic I posted) and you had a gorgeous fat curvy ass and your thong was showing as well. All the guys walking by were checking you out. I'm guessing you were Puerto Rican and in your early 40's, long black curly hair, full lips, and big boobs too. Anyway I got on the f train with you and you had smiled at me, I wish I would have talked to you but the train was crowded and didnt want to embarrass myself lol. You also got off at the next stop at 4th ave but I had to stay on the train. Anyway, I was the tall (6'2) white guy, green eyes, light brown hair I'm also 31 years old and I love sexy Latinas like yourself. Your body was so thick and curvy and was thinking about you riding my cock all the way to work. If you're reading this, I'd love to hear from you or any other sexy women who fit this description. I have pics to trade and then we can meet up for some fun. Thanks for reading.

I really miss you. I keep telling myself it was never able to be anything and it never will. I keep trying to not contact you, but whenever something happens my first thought is you. If it is good or bad I think to you. I can go a couple days without your name on my tongue, and all of the sudden I have to say it out loud just to make sure you were real. I wish things were different, yet I'm glad they aren't. Such a difficult place to be, between wanting and needing not knowing the difference. I'll take your smile on a Sunday morning for hours. Big spoon, little spoon it doesn't matter I just want to be next to you. Even as your strictly platonic. I hate this place I found you, I hate this place I look for you- I hate that you don't want me to find you. I'm sad you don't miss me, I'm sad I miss you so much and it just sits in me.

What happened to us? - w4w

It's been some time now since we last saw each other. Things ended on such a sad note. After all these years I still feel a connection to you. We always had a special connection and now no matter who I come in contact with it's not the same. I feel as if fate brought us together months ago but due to shock and disbelief I could not get myself to talk to you and I regret that now because I'll never get the chance. The chance to say I'm sorry for everything. We are only given one chance in life and if I could redo it and make it right I would. But for now all I can say is I'm sorry and I would love to tell you in person. If our paths cross again you'd be damn sure I'm gonna take that chance. We have a lot to catch up on! I want you back in my life!

Work Romance - m4w

Is it only in my mind or are you are flirting with me at the office? Is your tempting me real or just some amusement? It is too risky to actually approach you directly to find out if there is mutual interest to explore something discreet. I am pretty sure you are attracted to me. If I knew you would be open to a discreet relationship, I would go for it because I do sense that we would be very hot together. So I hope you see this and reply. Put "Work Romance" in title of your message and tell me something so I will know it is you when you reply.

I was the 32 year old handsome white guy, light brown hair, green eyes, full lips, and tall 6'2, and this is to the curvy Latina I saw on the N train Wednesday morning 9/28 (about 9:15am) while I was heading to yet another day at the office. You had dark brown curly hair, beautiful brown eyes and really big boobs to top it off. You were wearing blue spandex pants and heels. As I usually do, I'll take a nap before I have to get off at 57th st, but this time I dozed off and woke up as the train was pulling into 34 th st, I unfortunately realized I had a huge hard on (all 8 inches of it) when I woke up and it was pretty obvious. I initially tried to "adjust" my pants and i was looking around the train car, you were sitting right across from me staring at me and my umm..problem. I was so embarrassed having that happen in public, that I looked away. You had gotten off at the next stop at times square and as you were getting up I looked in your direction and you licked your lips at me as you walked out. Then the train doors closed. I'll admit I've been fantasizing about having hot sex with you since I saw you. If your reading this I would love to hear from you. Thanks.

Couldn't stop due to traffic and didn't want to interrupt your conversation.

You and two of your friends got on in south BK heading toward north BK this past weekend. I was wearing a black rain jacket and blue flannel. I stole a few glances and saw you doing the same.

I asked if you were waiting for someone... - m4w

You were sitting on a bench. Very attractive and it took me a little to approach you. I quickly asked if you were waiting for someone. You said yes. I didn't ask if it was a bf or just a friend. I wanted to ask you to dinner. Describe yourself and where this was so I know it was you. If you are single, let me know. If not, I hope you liked the attention.    


Released - m4w

You shouldn't need me to say anything in order for you to let go. Let go and live your life. You're the one keeping yourself from happiness not me. Im sleeping good at night and only think about how i'm going to reach my next goal that i've set for myself. I love my wife and you made me realize that. We may not be perfect but we work and im willing to fix anything thats broken. I hope you find your place in this world and someone great to enjoy life with. This will be the last time you hear from me. Take care.

re: Not a friend material - I am happy - w4m

I am happy because of you, don't get me wrong but because you are out and that's why I am happy. That is the truth. So, I am going to say pass. You cannot be trusted, you stabbed me in the back over and over and funny that recently you were willing to stab him in the back too. You cannot be trusted. I see what you post here too and what you posted behind my back, I have almost all of the posts. You lied to me repeatedly when I asked you about that. I recently offered you something and you declined, it hit me later that was because you were covered, not a dime is coming out of you because of your situation.


the best day of my life - m4w

Fantasy At The Video Store - m4m

Hi.  I have a secret fantasy.  I walk into an adult video store.  I see a nice guy behind the counter, we say hi and I go to the booths looking for a nice cock to suck.  In the booth I start to think about the guy at the front counter.  I would love to suck his dick.  My kinky side wants to suck his dick behind the counter where he works.  Or, I motion him to come see me in a booth. Either way, I want to suck his hard dick until he shoots his load in my mouth.


Thank you!! - m4w

Thank you for making another attempt at sucking all out of me. I am not at all sorry for pushing you away. While you tried to take everything away again, just feel pity that you are left with nothing around you. Your loneliness was what you want as journey in life ? That's all that mattered to you. You got it. Everyone is born alone and dies alone. I feel pity on you that you ended up as a loser, incapable, with lack of any success, you say you are with someone but still lonely, alone and miss all you had. Please continue living in your hole that you tried to dig up for me. You did bag a good one who will take care of you and you be a trophy to them. You are all set. In a city of over 8 million people and a place where you can make all your dreams come true, what you don't have is you yourself, own identity, your job, your work, your friends, your circle, YOUR OWN LIFE.

swiping apps suck! - m4w

So I am not much of a writer, and when it comes to talking about myself i'm even worse... I'll give this a try anyway. There is this girl (I know how cliche) that I find myself incredibly drawn to. She more than likely has no idea I exist but maybe she does. I believe our paths have only crossed once and I probably blew it during our very awkward exchange. I know that what i'm looking for will never happen, but I think about it (her) all the time. To be fair I doubt our paths will cross again but who knows.

I Waved To You from my Car - m4w

I was driving on Woodhaven Boulevard on Saturday night (Saturday, September 24) and came to a red light. I looked over to my left and saw you looking at me from the passenger seat of the car you were in. I got a good vibe from you and I waved. I couldn't see who was driving the car you were in, a man or a woman. Before our cars took off, I looked at you again, and you were looking at me pleasantly. We nodded at one another before our cars drove off.

Walking north on 3rd ave this evening - w4m

We were both walking north on 3rd ave between E 82nd and 86th around 1030pm. Looked like you just finished a run or were coming from the gym. I was hoping you'd say hi but I probably wasn't giving off those vibes. Wish I had said something before I turned to cross the street and we parted ways.    


Good evening - m4t

Hello lovely ts and cd. Hopefully this catches your attention. I am a young Hispanic male who's only looking to have safe, discreet fun. Any race is fine. Tall is ok but not too tall. 5'8 is the tallest I prefer. Short is ok as well. Safe sex is a must. It doesn't have to be today but we can try to schedule a day for us to meet. It's mainly a one time thing. If we enjoy the experience, maybe I won't mind meeting a second time. 420 is ok. I don't want you to turn me down because I smoke. I won't smoke if you don't smoke. I can't host but I will travel to you. I take public transportation and I don't drive. If you're interested please send a picture of yourself and stats. I want to know that you are who you say you are and you look like how you look in the pictures. I will send a picture to show you that I'm real as well. Put the subject title as "interested in meeting". I hope this reaches out to someone and I can meet you. Enjoy your day. I am a top by the way. I don't bottom.    


Helpful Pharmacist - m4m

I was getting a refill of my prescription this afternoon and you were at the counter. You helpfully pointed out that if I were to go online and print out a coupon, I wouldn't have to pay anything for the prescription and you told me to come back later with it. You even wrote down the website for me to go to on a piece of paper. Really wanted to say thanks for being so nice to help me out, and it would be wonderful to see you outside of your work clothes too. :)    


Missing the taste of you - m4w

I miss the way you taste and I know you miss it too. When we were together it always felt like we never worked but when we fucked we always felt at our best. You now have someone and I do too, but no pussy ever compares to the taste of yours and no lips have ever felt the same wrapped around my cock. If you find this and believe this is you, email me. Here are a few clues.

Gorgeous brunette exiting ACE station at 8th & 16th around 7:15pm - m4w

You were exiting the ACE subway station at 8th ave and 16th st at 7:15pm on Oct 11, 2016.  You were walking up the stairs.  I was standing at the top, admiring how unbelievably beautiful you were.  We made eye contact and smiled at each other.  As you got to the top, you said, "Thank You".  I replied with a fluttering heart.

Looking for an old friend Matt from LI & NC - w4m

I am looking for an old friend Matt who lived upstate for a while and has a house in NC. We knew each other from long chats about random things as we tried to get some work done in the uber generic coffee shop :). We haven't talked in over a year and I've been abroad so I haven't seen him but with all the flooding I'm just hoping he's okay. Just sending out well wishes that he is healthy and safe as well as his loved ones and home. If you see this and are okay maybe send me some smoke signals or something. I changed my number so maybe morse code here :) 


A Midlife Lament - m4w

On some level, I feel content and successful. I'm educated, and I've got a decent enough job, a family, and no real burdens. And yet.... when I was younger and imagined approaching 50, I always saw myself as being a more dynamic and important person to my friends, family, and colleagues. It's not as though they completely ignore me, but now I feel myself always being on the periphery, always watching and worrying about pleasing others while not getting that same concern from them.  I guess I expected that it would be better -- that I would matter more.

Hangover - m4w

I guess that's what I get for drinking. I find myself trying to forget you. Trying to come up with nasty things to say but I just can't. Your so dam cute! I just don't know what to say or believe anymore but getting over it is the worst part. Gladly the memory is fading, but I just feel so stupid. You always found my misery to be funny, it kinda is funny, but here you go. Laugh your ass off.

Uptown A train today around 6:30 - m4w

You got on in Harlem and sat in the row to my right. You're tall, curly hair, nicely casually dressed. I'm tall, glasses, dark hair in a black jacket with dark blue pants. You were focused on your phone for a little while (aren't we all? lol) but then we glanced at each other via our reflections in the mirror; later you turned to your left and I turned to my right and we made eye contact. We glanced at each other again when I got off at 190th.


Spoke today at Empire Clean Cities event - m4w

Hi there. We spoke for a few minutes about making clean energy choices at home. You were friendly, helpful and seemed like you cared about important things. You were wearing a blue top with a sharp sense of style. I wanted to ask you to go for a drink sometime and chat, but I thought it would be rude to do in front of your colleagues. Anyhow, I'm just hoping you see this by chance!

I love it soo much I'm willing to pay upwards of 350$ an hour to schedule a time to watch you do this. We can meet in public (always public for both our concerns) and you can study or whatever and I'll discreetly watch your natural dangle.


Q train around 9 am this morning - w4m

Hey tall guy with your semi long brown hair and beard. You got on the train, I think, around Prospect Park? I like your style with your blue bandana around your neck, layered grey sweater and camel colored coat. I even liked your dated cheesy wallet chain. You have a little bit of a viking vibe and a alluring stoic expression.

Josh, it was Friday night and I looked lost to you as I searched for my destination- Buddakan. You were kind enough to stop and ask me if I needed help and then the helpful conversation became flirty as you asked for my number. It was my idiotic instinct to say I have a boyfriend when being hit on, but I actually am single and did not know how to take back that statement. If you're out there, Josh, the tall handsome brunette with the cute glasses, please email me. I'd take your number any day if I ran into you again. Sincerely, Melissa the cute Asian in the long black dress looking lost on 9th Ave.

I feel like in this culture of grindr, jackd, and tinder, the level of objectification, shallowness, and absolute devaluing of other human beings if men dont want to automatically fuck the 2 dimensional (often posed, edited, and inauthentic) image associated with the person, they act like that person posses no value and is unworthy of human decency. This honestly disgusts and turns me off.

Frank. B&N - m4m

Hi.


Hockey Player on the purple line Oct 6 - w4m

You were the Hockey player that got on the purple line about 8 PM on Oct. 6. Dark hair, blue eyes, all in black. You were standing near two people sitting on a bench. A blonde guy and a girl with pink and purple hair and glasses. Was your name Mike K?  You looked a lot like someone I used to be friends with, but it took me a minute to place. If so, I am kicking myself for not saying something. But what were the chances of such a random thing in NYC?    


Berry Park - m4w

You were with a rather large group. We made eye contact several times. If you see this, send me a message. I would love to meet you for a drink.    


Pourhouse - presidential debate

I've never done this before and I feel like it's a long shot...You were by the side entrance and I was towards the back, I couldn't stop looking at you, (sorry if I seemed creepy but I was so attracted to you) I hoped you'd notice me. I also hoped the girl you were with was your sister... You had a hoodie with drawings of chess pieces on it. I have long curly hair. If you see this, answer and describe what the girl you were with looked like...only if, again, she's hopefully not your girlfriend.    


re alike but alone

Thank you for your raw honesty.

I had the stripped brown and beige hoodie with the golf cap to the side over my locs and got off at Utica. I think you stayed on. Hope you see this and get to me.


Beautiful girl at Belmont Park - m4w

You were at Belmont Park today with three older gentlemen, one in a wheelchair .  I'm assuming you drove your dad, uncle and grandpa for a day at the track, and I think that's amazingly awesome of you. I thought you were so beautiful.

Esther.......

I saw you last night around 10 at night. Something told me you wanted to talk. Then I saw you standing in front of your driveway, facing my house. By the time I went outside, you were gone. I think this time around I'll stop looking out my window for you; I never really know how receptive you'll be. Anyhow, I feel very good that I'll get the job where my mom works. If I do, I am still going to send you what I wanted.

I was chilling in the car just listening to music at the back of the lot and you were parked next to me. You kept on looking over at me and staring and licking your lips.

I dropped my umbrella at your feet - m4w

You sat across from me on the C train going from Brooklyn to Manhattan. I was stunned by how beautiful you were and didn't make a move, though I was thinking about it the whole time. As I got up for my stop, I dropped my umbrella at your feet and looked up at you and we smiled at each other, before I had to leave. I wish I stayed on for another stop to talk to you for even a few minutes. I would love to take you out for coffee if you ever see this.    


Ft. Lauderdale - March 1979 - m4w

We never saw each other again after that night, but I can't tell you how many times I've thought about our date and treasure the memory.

It was so hot, we ended up going in a closet and you blew me to completion. You invited me over to your place in emails after but my work schedule never let it work out.

We connected at Taylor Mac's 24 hour show - m4m

Okay, so let's get real here. We were at judy's show for 24 hours and I made connections with a couple of guys. I didn't even think of asking for a phone number from any of them because I was so caught up in the show. But it would be cool to grab a drink with one of those guys and talk about the show and see if we have a connection beyond that. The guy I connected with most was during the Brooklyn tenemant number, when Taylor asked us to make googly eyes with someone nearby. If you think that might be you, email me and let me know what I was wearing / what part of the room we were in.    


Nerdy Girl - m4w

Who are you? My eyes caught you a couple of times before the show started. And then afterwards they caught you again and I feel like yours caught me too. Maybe you were looking past me? But I felt like you were delving deep into my soul and I left enchanted. I couldn't turn away. I don't know if you were with someone. But I wish I had asked. If you see this, tell me what I was wearing...    


MTA bus driver with the beard - w4m

I was the short, curvy, black girl with my friend. You said "How are you doing?" when I got on and lingered after I said goodbye getting off. I was too shy to go back. If you see this, put the title of the email as the bus line you were driving.

Hey man - you came in shopping today and I helped you place an item on hold for a bit, this is probably crazy and highly unlikely but i just wanna say you're a total babe, insanely charming, and have a smile that probably makes grown men melt.

Comic con. saturday. 6pm maybe? We were across from each other making Lego pictures at the Lego booth.

You called your grandpa while you made your Lego thing. you were making a Roy G Biv picture first, then idk what. I made a bee. There was also a penis picture in there, lol but I didn't make it. You had joker face paint and blue shirt. If you see this, let's talk.    


207 1 train - Red Toms, blue jeans, grey shirt - we shared smiles - m4w

Ok. So I'm new to this, but we locked eyes and smiled a few times on the way uptown on the 1 train. You got off on 207th Street around 8:30pm or so. Not sure exactly when you got on, but you were with 2 other girls who got off like at 181 or 191 or something. You had your hair in a top bun, but since I wasn't alone I didn't say anything. Sucks to be me. I kinda don't expect you to see this but if you do, I found you incredibly beautiful and I would like to share some more smiles and stare at you some more (not creepy, right?) Reply back - tell me something about me or send a pic or something I guess to confirm who you are.    


Well This Is Fucked Up! - w4m

sometimes things hurt - t4t

lightning, like the dynamo sometimes things fall apart. but thats natural, like entropy. im not in the midwest or florida and i might not have a reason to be sad. maybe thats why my chemicals are off. i always wanna write a poem and so i start it with something about "you". thats why this is about no one cause it can never be about anyone bc there is no one for it to be about. thats why i find lack of crushes paramount tedium, im the worst at being a romantic but im still booling.


Locust Ave. - m4w

We live in the same building and talk from time to time.  The last time was a few weeks ago and you told me that you were no longer happy with your husband and were thinking of leaving him in the future.  You also proceeded to show me your apartment but left the door ajar in case someone came home.  I wanted to make a move on you so bad but I know you still respect your marriage.  You are older than I but look great for your age, as I compliment you all the time.  I proceeded to ask when the last time you were intimate and was shocked at the amount of time.  Doubt you will see this but I want to put it out there that if you ever need to be satisfied don't hesitate to ask.

pretty brunette w redhead friend on 2/3 train. told u to go to 50th - m4w

OK ive never done this before so I hope this comes out all right. Earlier today, around 1:30 give or take, we got on the same train at 14th st & 7th avenue. You were without a doubt one of the most beautiful women I've seen on a subway before :) . You were wearing a leather jacket, and you had long brunette hair. You were with a friend who had very bright red hair. I overheard you guys talking / asking about directions and I told you to transfer to the 1 at the next stop, to take it to 50th st. The train ended up going local so you stayed on. When we got to 50th I reminded you that it was your stop and you guys left and you politely thanked me. I hope u guys had a good time, wherever you wound up! Well I'm somewhat shy but I would have loved to ask you if you'd like to grab a coffee sometime or drinks or if you'd like to and have an idea of you own, sure :)  Anyway, I know this is a long shot but I figured hey, we only have one life to live so why not try it, what's the worst that could happen?? If you're out there... tell me something so I know it's really you, maybe something you or I was wearing or anything you  may think of.

Yes it (May) seems like I'm just the biggest flirter but Im really not - m4w

Most of those people you see me speaking to really just want someone to talk to. About life, most of the time close to personal life. With me being a genuine good listener here in the city when most people simply want someone to listen to them for once, they connect with me on a deeper emotional level.  


For you - m4w

Good Afternoon Precious,

I was walking behind you with a friend around 7pm in Penn Station. You turned around and made eye contact....then turned forward and turned back again for a few seconds. I wasn't sure if you thought you knew me or wanted to get to know me, but either way, you should've said hello.

I know you are married, but I have a good feeling you have a "Bi" side.  If you see this and what I'm saying is true, don't worry, I'm very good at keeping discreet secrets. I hope I'm reading you right, so if you are interested, hit me up with your initials, what class we are in, and what you did today during lunch .

This is the last time. - w4m

This is the last time I am letting you pop back into my life.  I am tired of your games. I am tired of you treating me like an object. If there is one thing I learned from our breakup and your games, it is self respect. It may have taken me a while, but I found it. After now going on two years of you popping in and out of my life at your convenience, I am done. I used to pray you would come back, now I cringe. I cringe because I know you are only back for one thing and one thing only. Why you want to continue to hurt me, I don't know. You already got your revenge, and you aren't getting sex, so I don't know why you continue this stupid game. I loved you. I wanted to continue to love you. But I just can't take THIS anymore. Go play these games with the others with "gorgeous smiles". Let me erase you so I can find someone to treat me right. Someone who actually treats me like a person. I wish it had have been you, though.  We could have been happy. You will always be my missed connection. And I probably will always have love for you, even when I try not to. And no need for anyone to reply. If HE reads this, he will know it is him. And he will know he really messed up and needs to try something else if he ever wants me in his life again. And to those who think this is about them, then you too need to stop your hurtful words and actions.    


Looking for Maggie - m4w

Maggie,


Do u miss me like I miss u? - w4m

This is hell, not having u to look forward to.  I miss you more than I should, and I can't do anything about the emptiness that I feel because of all this.  We connect on so many levels - but I miss you as my friend the most.  I miss your face. I miss laughing with you.  Your "college smarts".  Repeating the same things at the same time...it's still crazy to me. Please know I didn't respond to your email, because i figured it was the smartest thing to do.  I hope someday we can try this again without the stress that ruined us before we even really began.  I miss you, babe.  God, damn do I miss you.  Get out of my head now, please!

You were with a friend who also has sunglasses and she wore a black top. You also had a small dog as well. I found it very sexy and hot when you got wet when the fire hydrant was unlocked. I'm not sure you live on the block or were passing thru by I hope you're one of my neighbors.

Re confessions of a crazy man - t4t

I believe you have realized you're a narcissist and have been able to see your errors on a human level; an epiphany full blown narcissists are ra rely able to achieve. Just work on your psychology and don't do something dumb, just read up on how to literally retrain your brain. It could take as long as you've been alive but it would be well worth it to feel human. Good luck :)

My Missed Connections... - m4w

My missed connections are many. I miss those texts you look forward to from someone special. I have been missing those butterflys in your stomach when you see someone that wants you. So now I'm here looking for someone that can relate to my situation. Someone that is in a marriage that misses those special moments with someone that cares about them. Someone that wants to talk and can relate to our current situations. I'm not looking to change mine or yours situation, just make it more livable. I'm hoping to find ONE special friend for and ongoing relationship. Someone to talk to and if the connection is there we can meet and take it from there. Someone that enjoys talking with me. Maybe that person could be you. A little about me... I'm white, 40, 6'1" tall and in good shape. I am very honest and love to laugh, though I haven't much lately. I live near the Downers Grove area. I travel a bit for work but was hoping to find someone fairly close, say maybe within 30 minutes of me. So if you would like to chat and see if there is a connection let me know. Please put your favorite day of the week in the subject line.

I got on the train and stayed in the door way,  you then moved to my side of the car in the doorway as well, still always looking at your phone. I got off at Chicago ave stop.

It's always the same old story. I'm a 20 year old swm, and I'm always getting infatuated. It's always with someone who's out of my reach, too. I show up just late enough to miss everything. You're beautiful, you're cool, whatever it happens to be, I'm on the sidelines feeling sorry for myself. I'm pathetic, weak, and need to get a life. Jobs and hobbies, not so hard to find.

how are you just gonna sneak up behind me like that at work, grab my waist, thank me for my hard work, then run away all giggly!! the way you carressed my lower back and whispered in my ear really turned me on. the reason I responded "no problem" is because I wasn't paying attention and thought it was someone I knew playing a joke on me and when I turned to look I didn't know you lol. but you were so damn fine i was almost amazed that a girl as pretty as you just did that to me. i was going to ask for your number but you ran away!! and i was gonna chase after you but i couldnt leave my job :/ sorry for the late post I was hoping to see you shop there again but I haven't seen you since. If you wanna hang out and grab a drink sometime respond back to me with what store it was at and where you did that in the store.

Attn: J-Gabe

I put up with her for fucking years. Went back time and time again. You probably didn't agree with how I go about it, but now you know what that soul sucking, lying junkie whore's true colors are, you might at least somewhat understand the reasons I act the way I do. 3000 dollars in silverware from my grandparents house a year and a half ago was the last straw. She should be a two time felon, but I was still sick and didn't have it in me to go through with the charges.

I was on a first date last Saturday. The ysual, meet for a coffee and see what happens sort of date. It was pretty obvious that there was not going to be a second date, but she   wanted to keep it going, and I didn't want to be rude, and thought the least I could do was not make a snap judgement of her, so I said yes to going to the bookstore. As soon as we walked in, she walked off on her own, pretty much confirming my initial thoughts on a second date. Started walking over to tell her I was leaving, and then I saw you. Yeah, I could've been less obvious about it, but how often does a guy see a true goddess? You were so perfect I could swear I saw an aura surrounding you. You had the most amazing eyes I have ever seen, a face that made me forget all about the other girl, so much so that when she came over and said she was ready to leave, I told her I was going to stay.

I wanted so much to be everything you wanted, but I guess the Universe has other plans for us both. I wonder what it would fell like to see you again after everything that has happened. Would you still smile at me with those marvelous blue eyes and wrap your arms around me like before?

Were you cruising me? - m4m

Saturday evening around 7 or so we were at adjoining treadmills. I'm just starting at the gym, in my 60's and just over 300 pounds. You are half my age, more or less and pretty fit looking. You struck up a conversation and asked a lot of questions that led me to believe you were trying to determine that I'm gay, single, living alone. Polite, but inquisitive. I know there are guys who prefer older men, and others who are into "chubby" guys, so I suppose you could have an interest in both?  Or it could be my imagination? Your workout pants weren't really tight, but somewhat tailored to your form so that a slight bulge in the front was evident. Could have been an erection, or just a jock or briefs that pulled your junk up and forward. Anyway, you said you were headed to the showers, but I had no plausible excuse to follow-I live nearby and dressed for the gym at home.  I thought about you a lot last night. If you see this, please reply no matter whether I'm right or wrong that you were flirting with me. Tell me the color of your workout pants and what it said on your t-shirt so I know it's not spam.

I commented on your arms filling out your sleeves and asked you to flex, which you did. I said how solid your arms are. You described yourself as 'fat with muscle'. You said the girls like it, but I hope you liked the attention from me. I'd love to see those arms without a sleeve covering them! Would you like to maybe have a beer or something sometime?

I found myself glaring at you as I scanned the crowd while working as the stage security. I couldn't help but to notice you since y'all were standing directly in front of me pretty much the entire show. I also noticed your appreciation for musical equipment and your hand gesturing interpretations of different sonic waves. You seem like quite the unique and interesting individual. Maybe you'll see this and we can talk?

After work I came home put on some basketball shorts and took my trash out. I was walking towards the back gate saw you and instantly got aroused. I figured you noticed cause my thin shorts allowed my dick to flop freely. I was definitely excited. As I got closer you held the gate open for me and said "I always have time for a bald guy with a beard." I said me too cause you also had a bald head with a beard. When I walked towards the dumpster you said give you a second you'd help me with that too. I didnt really need help but I accepted it because I thought you were so handsome, thank you by the way. You have a lot of tattoos and I mentioned how amazing they were. I asked how many hours then you replied with a comment. What did you say? You also have two dogs. I've been wanting to talk to you for so long and as soon as I got the chance I chickened out. We can see each other's patio's. Let me know our address so I know it's you.

You work at a gas station in spring grove i come in a few times a week for cigs, misc things and beer.

Im a little shy around new people and always chicken out  when i think about asking you out. I normally come in on my way home from work in the evening between 6 and 9 and i drive a silver chevy car. If this sounds familiar to you, and you are intrested in getting to know more, send me a reply and put the gas station you work at in the subject line so I'll know if its actually you or not.

Girl at forest preserve - m4w

You were sitting in the forest preserve parking lot alone in your car. I pulled up next to you. We glanced at each other multiple times. We looked about the same age give or take a few years. It's kind of unusual for a girl to be there alone. I got this vibe we were looking for the same thing... I waved at you when you pulled away. Not sure if you saw. We sat next to each other for a decent amount of time too. Let me know what color car you have, or what I was driving. Also which forest preserve or suburb did this happen in?. I hope we run into each other again. I will definitely say hi next time.

" Sexy,fit,curly,dream-blonde w/Huskie in Willowbrook nr RedRoofInn - m4w

It's been my 3rd day working at this warehouse and I've seen you walk past with you're gorgeous Huskie,with a black and white coat twice. I've lost all sense of being and my breathe was taken away ever since I've seen you. No other female ,be it " person-to-person " or online couldn't compare to you and I've been eager to meet you since. It's only that I'm working that I haven't gotten the chance to approach you because of the time constraints given the job requirements. But I'd love to get better acquainted with you. Tuesday, August 2nd , 2016 between 3:40 & 3:54pm, You walked past in a black hat, with your beautiful curly blonde locks sticking out the end of your black ballcap, with a black t-shirt on, and some light blue daisy dukes shorts, with your amazingly fit physique (my ideal lifetime, fitness partner would be), gorgeous, fit and strong legs with the perfect booty to compliment it and black/white low top gymshoes. You had you're large beautiful huskie, with a Black and white gorgeous coat on a bright yellow leash. You 2 graced passed me and I instantly fell in love. I'm very fit ,single and attractive myself and will relocate to Willowbrook soon from Naperville. I'm a very attractive mixed dark male that favors a few celebrities in likeness but truly down to earth and ready for one woman in my life. My heart skips a beat at the thought of you ,even though you're distant but somewhat within reach. I hope you see this ad and respond. I'm praying everyday that a sign graces your path to come to me genuinely on your own accord. And wish to make you the happiest lady every single day of your pretty existence. That's all that I would ever want from you at all. If you I actually have a break during work and we cross paths than I'll take this post down. Until then, I'll be waiting, praying and wishing upon a star. Until then my beloved. Hope your days are pleasantly well spent.

I took my chances, I knew you were a mess, but I had no idea you would be so cruel. After years of loving you from afar, of being that friend, I got to kiss you. It wasn't just a kiss. It was so much more. It turned into weekends at my place, some of the best love making I've ever known. Yes, love making. Not sex, or fucking. This was emotionally driven, passionate, and without compare. I wrote you letters and poems. Bought you flowers. Made you breakfast and dinner. I even did that painting for you. I couldn't help but love you like I have loved no other woman.

A day later, it became a hurricane while west of the Leeward Islands, and rapidly strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane. It impacted Haiti, Jamaica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, and The Bahamas. It is expected to significantly impact the southeastern United States, especially the U.S. state of Florida, as well as Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.

It seems as if you all are extremely busy at all times.

Re: Annoying hipster with aviator sunglasses and black bowtie - m4m

I don't understand why gay guys feel the need to attack one another. As if outside forces don't do enough to pick at us. Some gays feel the need to do a better job at being homophobic than straight people. What gives? Where did the respect go? Not everyone has to look a certain way but for goodness sake why care what someone else is wearing? Wearing skinny jeans, a bow tie, and aviator sunglasses makes someone pretentious? Way to pick your battles! When I see someone I find attractive I don't sit there and judge what kind of person he is by what he's wearing, because, after all, if I had it my way his clothes (and mine) will end up on the bedroom floor of either his place or mine. Who gives a shit?

I have heard you saying that in my head for over ten years, let me ask you, you emotional terrorist, how much does it hurt? I am not afraid of you, and you can call me on the phone, you know who I am, I am the one who does not fuck around. Go ahead and lie, say, dumb shit that makes no sense and be with fake people, go so far as to marry them, move to places with them, lie and, lie, and lie! Oh, well, I will never believe you and I will not entertain your shit, at all. I love you. You slap me in the face? Oh, well! I don't care. It's yours to hold. How much does it hurt, you will hear that at night, not me, I will put that under your pillow. It just depends on who I love that day right?    


LPAC locker room Thursday evening - m4m

We ended up getting dressed after showering in the same row. We kept exchanging glances, but couldnt tell if you're straight and flirty or what... That extended show of your hot bubble butt hasn't left my mind since, though. If this is you and you happen across this, hit me up and tell me what kind and color underwear you eventually put on and hung out in. Stud :)    


Murphys gas station employee, Wednesday 10/5 - m4w

I dropped in Wednesday afternoon to grab a water bottle and some gas after work. I caught you examining me for a short time before helping the lady in front of me with her cigarettes and scratch offs... I'd be lying if I said I wasn't examining your figure myself. You offered me some candy which I respectfully declined. That doesn't mean I don't love me some chocolate though ;)

Was in L.A. and thought of you - w4m

It was odd, once I got there I recalled an old conversation, you had talked about how you prefer LA over New York. For some reason I thought I'd run into you. Of course, that was very unlikely.


The Mid after Porter 3:15am outside - m4w

We were both waiting for our Ubers. We chatter for a while and got along great. You said you were _ _._ years old. You said you are headed to Milwaukee soon. Said that's where I was from. Before I was able to ask for your number, we spotted your ride and you bolted. I'd like to see you again when you're in town. If interested reply with any missing info so I know its you and we can take it from there!

I sat in row 1 and we made small talk. You were super cute and funny. Hope you're home in Florida is okay with the hurricane. You're not from Chicago but i am so i posted here. I'd love to go out sometime, even though you're out of state. I travel a lot but I guess not as much as you!

The Teacher - m4w

Highly doubt you'll see this.   I was leaving Harper College about a week or two ago at about 930p.  You were chatting with a female student as you walked to your car.   I'm guessing that you're a teacher considering where you parked.   I walked out of H building, not sure if you saw me or not.  I remember you had what looked like black hair and open toe heels on.  What building were you coming from?    


M. at Blue Chicago - last Saturday - w4m

You asked me to dance but I told you I wasn't a great dancer. You didn't give up and were really nice (really).


e, i like like you

So I don't know what to do here. This is bad timing on all ends. I suspect this blissful feeling is reciprocated, but I'd rather not make myself a fool at the moment and, yeah, timing. Sending this out to the universe may help. May not. Just make a fake email address and reply and say anything.    


Sbarro Depaul Loop - m4w

You were done eating and walking out. I walked past and did a double take. You were wearing grey and black and glasses.

500 Park Blvd, Itasca - Deli Eating Area - m4w

We both eat in the deli often.  There you were again today.  We said hi to each other.  You were wearing a black skirt with a matching black / gray blouse.  You have black hair and are just as sexy with your glasses on as without them.  I am so attracted to you.  If by some miracle you see this, what color shirt was I wearing.  You are married and so am I.  Our secret I hope.    


Thurs AM- Brownline slip - m4m

The train floor and your shoes were wet and as the train lurched forward, you slipped a little to the pole I was holding on to. Might have been about Fullerton stop? We stood so close to each other after that; me wishing I had the confidence to have asked for your name then and there. Your eyes are an amazing green color. You were wearing a great shirt and had a grey backpack. Unfortunately I got off at Armitage and never saw you again.

I'm sorry, but I never got your last name, and if I did, I just can't recall it. You worked in the back of the warehouse by the shipping. I delivered parts.  We worked with a guy named Mike and you sat with a woman; I believe her name was Sue.  We didn't know each other for very long, but we always talked. You were always so nice, and it made going to work a better experience. I think you had a son.

I forgot your hair was curly until the last time I saw you, another check in the perfection column for me... you are tiny, brunette, sweet but not stupid about it, you are everything I've ever wanted and I'm pretty sure you hate me.  oh well I guess you just want a guy with "swag".  When will girls realize that cocky guys are just making up for their tiny....

I left you at a table full of young ladies in the lobby as I rushed off to catch my flight. Do you remember anything? We didn't exchange contact info. I need to know that you are okay! This is a long shot but I want to hear from you!    


Amy...... - m4w

You answered my CL personal ad somewhat hesitantly. You didn't include a picture, so I asked for one.  When I received it, I was blown away!  I have never seen a more beautiful being! I never expected to hear back after sending mine, but I did! You seemed to start the back and forth email thing that I am animatedly opposed to. but I obliged for the possibility of being able to meet such a beautiful woman.

When you can taste the love, priceless - w4m

And what is it to work with love? It is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart even as if your beloved were to wear that cloth. It is to bind a house with affection even as if your beloved were to dwell in that house. It is to sow seeds with tenderness and reap the Harvest with joy even as if your beloved were to eat that fruit. It is to charge all things you fashion with the breath of your own spirit and to know that all the Blessed dead are standing about you and watching. Often have I heard you say as if speaking in sleep he who works in marble and finds the shape of his own soul in the stone is nobler than he who plows the soil. And he who seizes the rainbow to lay it on a cloth in the likeness of man is more than he who makes the sandals for our feet. But I say not in sleep but in the over wakefulness of noontide he speaks not more sweetly to the Giant Oaks then to the least of all the blades of grass and he alone is great who turns the voice of the wind into a song made sweeter by his own loving. Work is love made visible. And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gates of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy. For if you bake bread with indifference you bake a bitter bread that feeds but half man's hunger. And if you Grudge the crushing of the grapes your Grudge distills a poison in the wine. And if you sing though as angels and love not the singing You muffle man's ears to the voices of the day and the voices of the night.

I MISS YOU and love you so much and the way you made me feel that I was the only one you wanted to make happy. I felt I was not good enough for you but that was my insecurity.  You sat there and listened to me and I sat there listening to you. I should of known we were soul mates when we wouldn't get upset about anything the other was talking about. You know where I am and life has changed. I am so ready to make it a life time and LOVE each other and experience the road together and with our dogs.

Pharmacist at west side safeway - w4m

You had to come up and clarify some confusion about my medication this evening. You are absolutely gorgeous and I don't think I was the only one admiring their view. If this is you, tell me what kind of medicine I picked up. I hope this finds its way to your eyes because damn, you are adorable and I can't get the image of your cute sheepish smile out of my head.    


Woman reading on bench at Rain City Burgers waiting on food order #9 - m4w

There's no way you'll see this but but I came into Rain City Burgers near University district around 7:45pm yesterday (Thursday 8/25) to pick up my food and you were on the bench facing the cash register reading your book with your ankles crossed. I believe you were order #9. You had on black flip flops with a red/purple polish. I was the young athletic guy that came in with shorts and backwards hat. Would love more than anything to connect with you.    


(NSFW) You changed your hair color again... - m4w

this time to red. When I saw you I almost told you how much I liked it, but I didn't because that might be awkward, considering we work at the same place. But now that that's changing, I think it's safe to tell you that I have these fantasies where you dominate me. Maybe you close the door to your office and then you ride my throbbing cock like there's no tomorrow. Or maybe I go to your place where you tie me to your bed and spread your legs across my face, making me eat you out. Mmmmmm. You're already in charge of some people and I want you to be in charge of me, making me your chief pleasurer. You recently learned of another side of me you didn't know existed, though this is quite a leap from that. Hopefully you'll be intrigued and aroused by the thought of me following your orders to do what you want to your body.    


Rollercoaster

Thanks for the mind games. I've landed on a manic high. Nothing like this before in my life. You know you were everything I ever wanted. Needed. No matter how toxic. But you took a good girl and fucked me up. I'm out there now. And on my own ride. Filling the void with everyone after me. I've been refusing this path but my heads in a weird place today. May as well fuck away the memories you've left me with. At least then I'm not yours anymore. I've got a lot going for me. Intelligence, beauty, huge loving heart and a bit of wild crazy cute too. I'm onto better than you.

I can't look at the stars. - m4w

I'll never stop wishing things between us hadn't ended in such a way. We've both long since moved on, but I've never stopped loving you. With the clearest certainty, I can say for sure you'd never believe that to be the case, but that "one last time, we'll both go our separate ways" will never be enough, and I'll never stop wishing I hadn't given up so quickly. It was always you; it just took me years to realize it. I'm happy to see and know you're healthy and happy, and as much as I wish I could have been the one to complement you in your amazing life, I'm forever a better person for having had you in my own, and that's more than enough for this distressed soul.

You're married and so am I, but I would love to just kiss you; you are so damn attractive, kind, smart and thoughtful. We're the same age, but you're my superior, making this all the more unlikely to happen, but you are too cute and you definitely know it.

To my jack off buddy "OJ".... - m4m

Soo not even sure if you'll read this or if your even still around, kinda hoping you are.  I know we stopped talking on pretty bad terms, but I find myself thinking about you a lot, and wishing I woulda got over my shit and just went with it all.  I got scared, kept making excuses, and I will man up and admit that I was an asshole...you were at at times too though ;) 


Safeway Federal Way - m4w

Black girl with black framed glasses and beautiful body.. wish i said hi.. you looked gorgeous.. was at federal way safeway on 320th.. let me know if it's you...and approximate time you were at the store... would love to reconnect.... 


what do you want? - m4w

I mean really though, me telling you that I yearned for you didn't change anything. Me coming clean on feelings I held for so long didn't cover the unattractive way I exposed myself. Apologies probably never helped if they were ever even cared about. Then again what can I say I guess I'm just a selfish lover, at least I'm always pleasant. It's funner when they fight back though. I just don't like somebody thinking they're gonna use words against me or trying to stunt on me, fuvk em. Them and the world, fuvk em both. Mostly just a bunch of pig brained peons and "elitism" searching sour pusses. I'm really starting to have some fun. I'd vaguely describe my recent victories but I'd really hate to waste the time if you didn't care and if you did it'd just piss me off that it's the only thing that would make it happen. Nice life. Sorry someone evoking me brought out me implying you're a lame again, I'm getting better at eliminating the reminders of all my feelings. But hey, hope life is well for you, real talk. if people even still say that

so hot and tiny - m4w

We work together and I can't get enough of looking at your tiny body. Oh, the things I would make you use your body to do to me if I could get you alone in a room. I have a suspicion you are curious about me, if not exactly attracted to me. We are both attached, but I have a major itch I need scratched. By you.

In another lifetime.... - w4m

I have a work crush on you, and the tension/energy is just....annoyingly incredible. There are so many reasons we can't and won't ever be together, but....oh my....your lips. I just want one passionate kiss. But this is probably all in my head, and you are probably blissfully unaware of me. Maybe I would somehow be satisfied if I just knew you felt the same way....but it's ok. Just knowing you, is awesome. Goodnight...J    


Can't believe I said nothing - m4w

Wow! I was in awe the second you came around the corner of the soda aisle, so much so I could barely mumble the words "excuse me" as I made way for you to pass by.  You were a beautiful burnette wearing a black jacket of sorts and gray yoga type pants...as you can see I'm not much of a fashion expert lol.  I'd say it was right around noon as I was there during my lunch break from work.  I was wearing a black hat with a bright orange construction sweatshirt.  Anyway, I wish I would have at least attempted to talk to you; however, I just couldn't get out the words to do so.  I passed by you once more and it was more of the same, so here I am, hoping you may see this and I'll have a chance to get to know you.

Michael, Starbucks barista... you ran out of tea (Tuesday) - m4m

We engaged in conversation while you brewed more tea for my drink.  You asked what floor I worked on and I told you I didn't work in the building, but I did tell you where I did work and what brought me in to your location.  If you're interested in meeting for a drink sometime and chatting more, email me back.  I found you to be very warm and genuine.

Soccer - m4w

So this is silly. I have this crush on someone. The problem is, its doubtful she even knows who I am. Well technically I don't know here either. But!!!  I've seen her around a few times now and every time I just melt.  We happen to have kids the same age and they play soccer together. Last week, our kids played each other.  It was very hard not to look at her the whole time... In fact, she was standing on the sidelines and I almost purposely walked into her. Maybe she was standing there on purpose? Wishful thinking.  We walked out at the same time last week too. I think she looked back at me when I looked at her (she had sunglasses on so I couldn't tell for sure).  I would love to grab coffee or just chat with her.  I doubt she'll read this. I doubt she's interested. But its out there now.

Love Tips for hearts - w4m

When someone gives you a chance to love them, and you want to be with no one else, take it. You must give up and surrender to love to reap the benefits of what this beautiful, rare gift can offer you. No one is really afraid to say I love you. It's only the fear of not having it reciprocated. If you have't told each other yet, It can definitely be thrilling to feel like you're both on the precipice of ~real love~. The stakes feel lower and you're always wondering if today will be the day you finally say it. But that gets old fast, and feelings tend to get hurt if you wait too long.

We had a little smile when you walked off the boat and saw me sitting in my car, but then later we were at a stoplight right next to each other. It was one of those times where we both peeked quick, sat at the light like we didn't care, and then exchanged glances right as we took off. You were ahead of me most of the way up the bridge, we got even and were clearly at least having fun flirting with each other, but then you took a right : (

fucked up my dinner and left me thinking... - w4m

Came in for dinner with my ex tonight.  He and I have a decent friendship and I have no romantic interest in him.  The thing is I know you can cook better than that.  I asked who was cooking when my cooked veg was more like crudite.  He said the soup tasted moldy. I think those potatoes were from last week.  I ordered med-rare and it moo-ed at me when it got to the table.  But I like Rare so it was still good, and honestly I'm scared what it might have came back out looking like.    So I got to thinking if you knew that you were making my food and did this intentionally.  Do you hate me? or can we try to get to know each other outside of that crazymaking kitchen.  I'm not ever sure what to say when we speak (which has been pretty limited) I get a little tongue-tied and I actually pretty flustered, because I actually want to know you better and hang out socially.  But i keep fucking it up. Maybe you want to also....it's kind of a longshot posting here, but I had to let you know I've been noticing you and hoping that you want to know me better also. (2 five tree tree S S zero sex hate tree)  text or call

I don't know why I say things I know I'm gonna regret late.  I don't want you anymore.  You squandered your many chances.  You chose to keep giving the best of you to him, as time kept ticking away.

Both of us finished up our workouts tonight at the same time, and were talking about the elections while getting dressed.

You bummed a light and then apologized when the smoke got on me, then shared a couple hits when I said I didn't mind. The name of the movie about Brian Wilson I couldn't remember is Love and Mercy. I enjoyed our chat. Coffee sometime?    


re.Still.. 123 - w4m

I dont know who is texting such horrible statments about the man I love but obviously you must have serious issues. This site was meant for people to reconnect there love ones. If you receive this message you'll know its me well do codes ask me a question only I would know sweetheart you'll know its me. By no means would I post to laugh. But only to reach out to you that maybe 1 day we can reconnect. Because I do love you. Someone out there is very mean and hateful towards us. I miss you sweetheart. All I would text is sweet loving thought a from my heart. You know that's how I am. I have no hate. But love for you. Come back to me.

Eye Contact with Coconut-Water Man - ww4m

on October eleventh, at eleven-forty to forty-five a.m., at a red light, five women sat in a car and made eye contact with a gorgeous man. He had beautiful blue Eyes- Flowing chocolate hair and a carton of Coconut Water. He initially made eye contact with the blonde woman in the front seat and stuck his tongue out at her cheekily. Then as we sat at the light, he made eye contact with one of us (we can't decide who) and motioned as if it was fine that he was missing the green light. What did this stunning man mean? We are all very curious about this man and just want to let him know how gorgeous his eyes are and ask about his relationship status. Please coconut-water man, who are you?

I saw you today and was struck by how classy and attractive you look. Such a nice smile and positive attitude. It really made the visit much less painful. You had in a black skirt and green top ( I'm pretty sure it was green) you remembered my last name when I asked you a question after you switched desks. I'd love to take you out for a cup of coffee sometime! Even if you aren't interested,  you being the first person sees when they come in really helps! Thank you for being so charming, even if you weren't trying

So we met twice. The second time unfortunately entirely too short time wise. In your car alongside I5 in Stanwood. I'd really like to meet up again and finish what I'd started.

Clouds Sky's stars moons colers feelings judgments hope inspiration life and its beauty and its wonders. With possibilities of hope never give up on anything even if it seems there's no hope life always has hope you just have to find that key and open that door to possibilities. Because hearts come and go but thay can change that is the hope you never give up on.

Dear Cute Cashier,


Monday night at 7-Eleven in Renton - m4w

You parked your white car (Grand Am?) and walked into the 7-Eleven around 11:45 PM.  I was sitting in my blue Subaru.  I couldn't help but stare at you---it might've come off creepy and sorry about that.  But I couldn't keep my eyes off you.  At the same time I couldn't tell if someone else was in the car with you, so I didn't come over.  Big mistake.  Feel like I missed an opportunity and am hoping you might come here, or have a friend who might tell you about this...

hella drama - w4m

It's funny I first looked on here years ago when I caught my ex looking for what he described as barely legal's. I saw the mcs and thought how sweet. All these people getting out their thoughts. Some people are completely afraid to share how they feel in person. Well lately every third post in just hatred and anger between whom ever. Chill the f out people. Relationships are hard and we have all been hurt.  I thought this was MC not bitter and beligerant. We have been guilty of instigating fights at a time. In all the time I've read these only 1x have I actually reached the right person. Though how would you know they were talking to you when noone uses initials or real detail? I will not post anger on here. That isn't the purpose. Give people a chance and speak in person if you are upset.    


Shame - m4w

I thought you would at least have tried to have some kind of response. There has been nothing from you no explanation no reasons no attempt at a justification not even a coded message. You figure that I already know everything so why bother spinning another tale when I wouldn't believe your lies  or a word you say. You proved everyone right.

Roosevelt Safeway - m4w

You were walking down the aisle with your hands full of groceries and I mentioned that you really need a cart. You laughed and as you reached for just one more thing off the shelf, you dropped a drink on the floor. I came back and picked it up for you and offered to grab you a basket. Unfortunately for me you were all done shopping and headed to the checkout. I was really hoping you had more shopping to do, so I could have grabbed you a basket and struck up conversation with you. I noticed as you rounded the corner you looked back. So did I. I'm not one to normally strike up conversation with someone at the grocery store, but to you, I did. I checked out right away in hopes to see you again, but no luck.

We met at the Fremont Dock Bar last year towards the end of June. You were a long blonde haired guy. I can't recall your name. We talked at the bar for quite a while and had some drinks together. I was there on vacation. You said you lived close to the Dock. When you left, I kicked myself for not following you out. I am not gay, and not sure if you are... but I thought you were hot!! That night made me very curious! We had a strong connection and I should have told you how I felt by following or objecting to you leaving. Having that moment with you was unforgettable! I'm not in Seattle now. Wish I was! That place is amazing! Anyhow, should you see this, please respond and let me know if you remember my name or where I was visiting from. Anything you remember talking about will let me know it was you. If you feel the need, attach a face pic so you can let me know that it's really you!

Clearly not either of our best efforts. Lol. I did have fun though. I wish I could go back and re live that moment when I just started taking my clothes off in front of you. Hope you remember it fondly, too.

Then a female friend joined you... you clearly told her about out looks exchange because she looked back at me specifically. Then when she hugged you she again gave me a look, almost of possession. She then took hold of your wrist shook it and said something to you and eyeballed me again. Are you hers? If you are interested let me know.

Yuck guys start having actual conversations. To the guys wanting to have sex with coworkers and posting here maybe you ought to leave that space sex free since you will have to see them daily. And finally to all the guys who see people on a regular basis but post here is nuts. You actually see these guys, start talking to them. Be bold. It will often get you rewarded.

Second time around - w4m

Not sure what to think about you right now. You split from your girl about 2 months ago. You started texting me again about a month ago and now we text almost everyday. I don't regret what's happened between us in the last month but I hate not knowing where I stand. We did this before, 10 years ago. I don't want to be a rebound. I don't know if I can do this a second time. We have both changed and grown as people and the past is the past. Part of me wants to see where this can go, the other is afraid. All day yesterday in the truck I wanted to ask you where this is going but I was scared to know I think. You may not even know yourself right now. Am I willing to date you again? The answer is yes. But I need to know where you stand.

I loved your smile and everything about you :) I couldn't help but stare every time you walked by. I doubt you will ever see this but I hope if you do, that I was able to bring a smile to your face. If you're interested in chatting and becoming friends, reply with what I ordered or anything that will let me know it's you and not someone pretending to be you. I was with 2 other people. We sat in the booth that's right next to the entrance to the kitchen. I didn't get your name since you don't wear a name tag. We came in around 7:30am. If you think this is you but aren't sure, feel free to reply with any questions to help narrow it down. I hope I get you as a waitress when I'm in this week.

Dear Stranger,


KELL I miss you and think of you often - w4m

Kell we used to see one another a few yrs back, we both were busy. I used to love emails that we would share between one another, things for me have changed in a big way I'm not restricted as I once used to be. I miss you dearly and long to be in your embrace.    


re.still... is correct. - w4m

I realize the light house deemed a long time ago. For us. I know this cant be true. The em ail you sent me is not you, only a kind person giving hear to my heart and thoughts. God has comfort me threw my thoughts and dreams.  I rest alone with God. I was hated by you, treated with shame. but I am not ruined. no one ruined me. You ruined your self. Know that God forgives and loves everyone no matter how bad or shame you have caused. I am still without a mans love nor do I need it. I was born with this light to show all of you there is still hope.

The Wave Apartment - m4w

This is a long shot but I met you, white girl with short brown hair and beautiful eyes. I remember talking to you while I was very drunk and I forget your name or who you even knew at that party after Seven Lions. I just wish I got your number or something. Couldn't tell if the guy next to you was your boyfriend or not.

And it may take some time to


always you - w4m

No matter how much I tried to forget about you and meet someone else who would be less complicated with less "baggage" I just couldn't push my longing to be with you out of my mind. No one is perfect and we all have something but in so many ways I see you are perfect for me. I am excited and relaxed by you all at once. I had no idea how articulate and well read you are. I often date down in the intelligence dept. Not trying to be stuck up but it's true. You and I are both a little faster. I feel more challenged and you hold my attention which doesn't happen. I feel like losing you would be a huge loss.

You were with a few people so I didn't approach you, kicking myself now cause I can't get that vision of you out of my head! There was something about you, besides your beauty. Light. The way you laughed. Your dog was cute, too ;-) You'll probably never see this. But if you do? Let's laugh together!

You were my straight/married massage therapist - m4m

You are a sexy, friendly, straight, married massage therapist. I found you very attractive and enjoyed our conversations. I wanted to try my luck and pushed the envelope once, slowly moving my hand toward my crotch toward the end of the session. You got embarrassed and left the room, but were very friendly afterward and in our following sessions. I assumed you disapproved but it was never clear to me- maybe you were aroused and felt shy about it. In any case if this sounds familiar- let me know who you are by confirming the camping recommendation you gave me this summer. If you don't remember telling me, you told me a good campsite next to a body of water when I was thinking of places to go with friends.

You missed coffee... - m4m

We were supposed to meet for coffee today in Fremont at Milstead & Co coffee at noon, but you didn't show. I arrived before noon, waited for twenty minutes until it was obvious you weren't going to show.  We chatted all week about it until Friday morning.  A, you're from a middle eastern country, been here since you were 17, recently moved to Seattle for a job.  You're an artist and animator for computer games. I thought we made a connection, and I'd love to expand that connection.  If something I wrote upset you, it was never my intentions.  I know you said you were bothered Thursday because you felt homesick.

We were both shopping and it looked like you just got off work. I was checking you out and you definitely got my attention. We are both white and pretty decent looking people lol. I should have said something but really didn't know how without making it awkward in walmart of all places. You were younger than me, slender/average but thicker from the waist down and just my type. Looking for friends, coffee, discretion or dinner/dating.

i was just a convenient distraction - m4w

I know you had just got out of a relationship and got a lot of shit dumped on you, I just wanted to help you out at first.. But then I ended up falling in love with you, I fell in love with everything about you, your dorky laugh, your beautiful eyes, the way youd look at me, the way you'd get goosebumps from my touch, your smell, the sound of your voice. I didn't think I would find somebody I could feel so comfortable with, to open up to, someone I would do anything for. But if you supposedly felt the same way then why would you talk to him the way you did? I read all of the messages, how could you do that? For someone who was cheated on why would you do that to someone and take it that far? I loved you so much that I couldn't ever hurt you, I didn't even talk to females while we were together because you were more important to me than anyone and I didn't want to end up hurting you in any way, shape, or form. But I guess it's just flirting right? No big deal, right? I'm just a jackass for making a big deal out of it? Then you tell me you want to be single and you want to get your life together. I catch you flirting with some dude and suddenly you want to be single, no talking about it, just.. Sorry.. I was the first guy you started talking to after your last relationship, you fell for me so fast because you needed to fill the emptiness from what happened and after I had given you what you needed, you decided you were done with me, I gave you the perfect excuse to end things. They say men usually end up with women like their mothers and you have more in common with my mother than you think you do, I understand you way better than you think. I just wish that you would see that even now I want to be with, I would still do anything for you. Being just friends with you is worse than if you never talked to me again, that way I would probably be able to get over you. It takes a lot out of me not to hate you because I love you so much. Not because of what you did but because of how I feel about you and not being able to be with you. You have no idea how hurt and pathetic and weak I feel. I wish we could have worked out, I wish I could have done something different.. I'll never hate you though,  even if it kills me, I'll always love you

Gardening with a dusty rosebush - m4w

I should have listened when you raised concerns about my schedule... now it's too late and I'm hooked.... it just feels like you're playing games and it's starting to seem like nobody will actually love me... apparently I just appear as some sort of object of temporary pleasure or confidence. Why did you let me in if you don't want me in??? Is it all because I guessed your name right (on the umpteenth try)

Re:aloha - m4w

You are delusional. 30? You wish and you lost the once young look you were blessed with. I guess that was another thing you lost being with him. Yet again still a great choice you made haha. It makes me laugh everytime I think about it. Sorry but it was me who dodged the bullet because everything that was said about you was true and you did nothing but go out of your way to prove that. We all know how it is that you make money and the lies that go with that. If what you believe I ever was about was lies that is only for you to live with how you turned on me and the lies you told but then again you were never real because you cheated from the beginning and that came from your own voice to another's ear. Tell me how that falls on me again? You are a liar and a thief and you are not a woman no matter how much makeup you put on or skirt you wear. That skirt comes up over your head the second someone has anything you want. You are not special and the manipulation you use to make anyone else feel special is false. You send emails to yourself portraying internet stalkers for your drama addiction. Your lies caught up to you this time and you were forced to pay for them. You will end up in jail one day soon.

Can't really believe I'm doing this but here it goes.  Also can't say too much on here either, wish I could.  You are a emt, beefy.

Our eyes locked in the lobby - w4m

I walked through the lobby several times and I felt your eyes on me each time I walked through. You were there waiting to meet someone. I came back out to get water and our eyes locked and you gave me a little smile. Such a great little smile. And you were so handsome. 


I listened to our song while going down memory lane... - m4w

We held hands everywhere, but while driving we would hold our hands even tighter every time this song played.  I also remember making this bouquet for you when I was depressed.  I met you at your work so you could give me a hug.  I'm thinking of you Beautiful.  Be happy and be well.  Remember to smile.

It's Friday night; Let's see what CL has to offer - m4w

It's Friday night.  Just seeing what CL is like!  One can never have too many friends, so would love to meet an amazing human I haven't met before :)  I am in my mid thirties, fit, sane, accomplished, and can check all the other boxes you might have.  Drinks in Seattle proper (downtown, Capitol Hill, Queen Anne, Ballard, Fremont, etc.) would be fabulous.    


Mercer Island girl with glasses at school bus stop - m4w

I was in my company truck making a delivery at a residence and you were at a school bus stop waiting for your child/children.. you had brown hair, you were wearing creme colored pants and had glasses.. you were so beautiful and I wanted to say hi so bad and possibly get your number to take you out sometime but I was stuck with the customer :/ I think you drove off in a silver car/SUV. I would do anything just to see you again and/or get your number so we can chat. Hopefully you see this and get in touch.    


Cute girl at El Chupacabra Alki - m4w

I was just in there with my loudmouth friend and I thought I caught a smile from the end of the bar, couldn't really verify since my friend was all up in my face and my ear the whole time.. Anyways I want to know you so if that's mutual let me know. You had on cowboy boots so friggin cute.    


Let's talk more about Greece and Cuba - m4w

This isn't something that I would normally do but I'm out of ideas and I can't get you out of my head. The first time that I saw you I knew there was something different about you and that I had to find a way to spend some time with you. I tried to manipulate the situation so that you would ride the bus with me and it worked. We shared a ride on the bus from Bellevue to the UW game that lasted 30 minutes but I wish it could have lasted eons. Message me if you ever come across this and we can continue to get to know each other.    


Dollar Store - m4w

I Saw you at the Dollar store.  Seemed like we had an amazing connection but, I was too shy to try to talk to you more than just in line.  I asked if you were buying Halloween decorations,  You said no "its just Jesus Stuff.  I would like to meet you!    


Diane  QCC, Safeway - m4w

Still think of you.....................................would love to know how you are.............Century ballroom,gay cowboys!!!    


Re missing ur scent taste.. - w4m

It's so sad when you try to reconnect with a loved one in the most passive way., However romantic it is its always a touch and go. This sounds like you need to be more specific, at least ask whomever responds to you for proof of this said lost love. I've been duped before, when I thought my bf was replying to my love letter on here. Had me going for a while, I thought it was just a game we were both playing turns out, sadly it wasn't even him. Beware of trolls. That's all and really best of luck in getting to see her again. I'm a sucker for love stories , hence why I can't stop reading mc

Conv about lunch in the elevator - m4w

We ran into each other in the elevator...both with our respective lunches. I had deli, you Japanese food.  Do you live in the building?  You're cute :)    


Aloha P - w4m

Life is like a box of chocolates isn't it? You never know what you're gonna get. You always did assume the worst about me... (Projection) and I always was too naive about you (also projection) . I did have to move on and find a life worth caring for. Court as you know is expensive and I wanted to flush that house down the toilet as bad as your memory. You said to me "it must suck. It must suck that you couldn't get me to marry you". And it did at the time, because I was so lied to thinking you loved me. Even though you struggled in your addiction to me I had hoped it was because of love. I had hoped I was a positive contribution in your life (however riddled with drama from inconsistency) because I saw your tortured soul. Never did I imagine that I was just a fix for you. Or I just never expected to hear you name it with hatred for all of the lies you told. Of course I told lies . Who is loyal to someone who is openly meeting only their own needs? I see what kind of a woman I am growing into . And I'm glad I'm doing it without your suffocating influence . You taught me some good things in life. One of them was making good money. Another was that I could have whatever I want as far as a connection with someone. The last was not to ever settle. I would have settled with you . 


Your scent...your taste...I miss - m4w

Of course I'm not going to list her initials. I will, however, confirm said mindblowing relations did not take place in Seattle.    


Let's smoke delicious buds and chat - mw4mw

October 6 Safeway parking lot - m4w

You were a nicely dressed woman (Indian/Hispanic) putting your groceries in your car in Safeway parking lot in Kent. Me a tall man wearing grey hoodie. We smiled at each other and I felt something. Just had to put this out there.

If you in this place I know u love me and I love you let's just stop and be with each other two because I seen the beautiful signs that you loved me and I know I will stop at nothing the right way to do it. To be with you.love jf forever yours    


Re\sex so good - w4m

This is getting good lol, do you know how many little ladies are out there and you're in Seattle, that makes it more difficult to figure out. Where is my popcorn! Why can't you tell her, do you really think she's even reading missed connections much less able to figure out it's meant for her? Do the ladies a favor, OP, post someone's initials or where you met at least. Crap in one hand and wish in the other and see what gets filled faster. Isn't that the saying LMAO. Idk. Happy Friday, y'all. Don't let the one you still love get away, without leaving your claw marks.    


Re: sex so mindblowing you gave me a concussion - m4w

I appreciate your curiosity, but the little lady for whom my post was intended will most likely be able to figure it out on her own; despite any residual doubt she has as to my own feelings that were or were not, I can only hope she'll realize I never did stop loving her, wanting to be with her, or missing her, regardless of my wholehearted ineptitude in mostly every aspect of our relationship previously.

Evergreen College Gym - m4m

We were both in the gym today about 230pm.  We kept making eye contact.  We ended up at the water fountain together but I was afraid to say something.   Tell me something about the workouts so I know it's you.  Or what was my last exercise ?

LAF Mill creek - various dudes - m4m

I workout there with some frequency - always guys there with wandering eye's, ya just never know what's up with people, gay, bi, maybe even curious but str8 after they see dudes in the lockers (don't be shy it's human nature) So come on, lets actually workout rather just look at the eye candy. I'm sorta buff, smooth, clean cuts and like most guys I to keep to myself at the gym. But very approchable and outgoing!


10/7 at Safeway - m4m

We met in the soda aisle at Safeway on 10/7. You tried to strike up a conversation with me, but I was oblivious and just made idle chit chat as I grabbed my soda. If you're interested in more than that, please contact me. You were sexy as hell.    


We are our own worst enemy - w4m

...when it comes to love. We are too stubborn and proud to say what we feel. Same with me--I am stubborn and proud and let you slip through my fingers. Didn't reach out when I didn't hear from you. And now I am pathetically hoping you'll see this on CL, since I deleted your number, thinking I would never hear from you again. I hope you meant it when you said you loved me, and that maybe you're just afraid I don't feel the same. Otherwise, I will let go entirely. To: CW    


Love you miss you - w4m

I sent you the thank you card hope you enjoy it. I would have said more but I know it's not allowed but wish I could tell you how I feel which is I love you!

Does anyone know what happened to Jenny that worked at Lynnwood Fred Meyer? Nobody would tell me and I have asked. I used to date her and its important I talk to her. Any information would be appreciated.    


auburn homewrecker

You were fucking my husband in his truck before work and during lunch ..and at your storage unit too. You both are ghetto, low class ,and sick . I hope you don't lose your job bitch.  I know my husband is telling you one thing and telling me another.  I have proof and I'll show everyone . You'll be pretty unpopular after that.  I hate you both and whatever you have coming to you is well deserved . Just wait for it.  Ugly old hag slut. Everyone makes fun of you and now my husband for fucking someone as gross as you are . Have him but you some whitening strips for your teeth.  They are gross    


Hey Jude

I don't say I love you anymore because it's foolish to say it to the air, without a catcher.  It hasn't changed for me.  It couldn't.  


Blonde on the 21. - m4w

I don't ride the bus anymore. But I missed giggling at the fact you hid vape hits on the bus. I miss you watching me. I miss seeing you on the one random day a week. I was going to ask you out but I stopped riding and I regret it. I was the Asian guy with long hair and a longboard.  If you know the girl I'm thinking of or if you the gal is reading this message me ;)    


Re: I miss you you than you will ever know - m4w

Reach out to him. Maybe he feels the same way and if you both have grown up maybe you can give it a try for real.

You were in checkout behind me in Lakewood today. Absolutely polite and friendly. I had on a long black dress. 


a little crush? - w4m

As I was sitting there waiting to be called, I couldn't help but watch you as you were doing your thing. I guess it's fair to say that I was crushing on you hard! I had my kids with me so I didn't think it was a good idea to put my flirt on and ask you for your number. Instead, I snapped your picture and figured I'd post it here on CL with the hopes that you use this crazy site. If this is you, email me. I'd love to learn more about you.

emotional overflow - w4m

This post is aimed towards the one who continues to rule my heart. His name starts with an A. and to be frank, I have no realistic expectations of him reading these lines, as he surely has a very busy life and does not cruise CL as I, in search of words spoken to and from the heart. Nevertheless, here I am, putting out what cannot be retained.

Damn it Jessica - m4w

We have a fucked up history together.  I have a hatred that prevents me from experiencing a romantic love for others.  Years have gone by and I am yet to have a successful relationship since ours ended.  But that's ok, I don't want any serious relationships in my future.  Just looking for a friend to fuck.

Salice or Chalice?? Seattle Skyline- At Kerry Park - m4w

wasn't love - m4w

It's pretty clear to me you've judged my frustration as a lack of love. I'm sorry if I ever hurt you, you put on a face like you were getting pure enjoyment out of it. At many times I felt like I was just a show for you, a final conquest on your search for a period in your life where you feel the strongest. I understand your decision though part of me definitely still wishes you'd find the time to grow with me. Sometimes I spoke out of pain and sometimes I spoke out of what I thought you wanted, but both times ended looking foolish. Live. Love. Laugh. I don't know if you've ever struggled with it but I've done my own version of it for a while. I guess building it in a way you might have respect for has been a door you've opened for me.I'm not mad, I care but then again how much caring do you get a return on your investment for? Well whatever I am, I hope you're doing well. Still miss ya, but I've learned to live without ya, kind of funny problem for someone who never had ya


Getting My Ducks In A Row - m4w

I'd be living a lie if you weren't in my life, especially  if it all boiled down to smoking. I'm not going to let that happen, so I'm quitting that nasty habit, and hoping it will help bring us together. Fall is setting in and I want to smell you on the wind.    


Woman reading on bench at Rain City Burgers waiting on food order #9 - m4w

There's no way you'll see this but but I came into Rain City Burgers near University district around 7:45pm yesterday (Thursday 8/25) to pick up my food and you were on the bench facing the cash register reading your book with your ankles crossed. I believe you were order #9. You had on black flip flops with a red/purple polish. I was the young athletic guy that came in with shorts and backwards hat. Would love more than anything to connect with you.    


I never knew your name - m4w

When we met online, you were a freshman at UW, and I was much older than you. We filmed our first encounter for your long-distance love, who then treated you like crap for having done it. When you took down your panties, it took my breath away to see the natural beauty between your thighs. You mistook my reaction and waxed it off the next time we met. We had fun in those evenings, and we never knew each others' names - though you found mine out when I got a new phone.

Tigers at McDonald's - w4m

You were in a wheelchair, recovering from a blood clot in your leg; I was in Onitsuka Tigers, which you complimented. I peeked in your backpack and saw a library book I'd read, but didn't mention it to you. I wish we'd had a chance to chat more -- maybe we can? (Leave the title of the book in your message, so I'll know it's you.)

Goddess with 10,000 names - w4m

It is so lonely a place, and i chose to partake in anything i could to be comfortably numb. It only worked for so long, and i am now no longer interested in unlocking any more secrets from my infinate memory bank of wisdom, or obtaining anymore useless fallible information that is recorded by men. I have been shown that nature and creature have fallen to a place where the only solution is LOVE and am prepared to begin the battle that will end time, and fulfill the long awaited prophesies. Never again will creature or nature be allowed to harm or use and abuse love ever again. Victory is in my veins, and i am faithful that my creator will honor my decision to begin the end and be victorius ultimately. The fates, death, time, angels, the fallen and the gods cannot stop me or persuade me otherwise and every soul and god will be judged according to their works and their hearts.

Memories of your scent - w4m

It has been months since we said goodbye. Yet, your scent, your mind, the peace you bring...all innate qualities that make you...still haunt. I'm a real person seeking an individual I've lost contact with. The individual is an Asian male. He would remember that I have blue/grey eyes and knows there are unique scars and individual art choices that also serve as identifiers. He loves golf and maintains his body due to his career...and adored the fact he unsettled my nerves of steel.    


Marysville - m4w

Maisy Chang, nurse, Stevens Hospital - m4w

Nurse at Stevens Hospital way back when.  I worked there, too.  Dad was a surgeon.  You had a place by the high school.  I was tall, dark hair, bearded and early twenties.  Never saw you after I left for Australia and settled in Santa Barbara. The folks say they used to see you at Husky football games.  Would love to catch-up.

Showstopper - m4w

You were the blonde that everyone knows, because you perform in one of the shows. I was just another well dressed guy, always wearing a nametag, a suit and a tie. I couldn't date then but now I can. I was transitioning from boy into man. I know you won't see this but somehow if you do, I will finally say how I feel about you.    


Dick's parking lot in Renton - m4w

I was in a red car, you got into either a charcoal or black Chevy cruz....I couldn't take my eyes off of you. You are gorgeous. You smiled and waved as you pulled out. I know this is a long shot, but if you see this, I would love to take you out sometime.

Shower Door Open at DT Gym - m4m

Showered next to each other this AM at the gym. You had no fear stroking with your door wide open for everyone to see, and also made sure I could see every inch through the glass. Bearded and hot, and you left right before me, in a red plaid shirt. You also watched me get dressed, especially when I didn't have a towel on....    


VIVO 53 - m4w

I was sitting across from your table and we where both with someone. I could not stop glancing over at your smile. Your demeanor was gravitating and left me wanting to know more about this alluring woman. Who are you and can we meet, so that I can know more about you. Hope this message finds you.

Waking up to your arms would have been better. Wishing to the stars that some day my love will be with me when I wake.

Why is it not me? - w4m

You told me it wasn't you. You said i need to put myself out there and meet new people. You have no idea how much this hurts, why is it not you? Of course it's you!! You are the one! I just wish i could understand. Wish you felt the same for me, but you don't. I'm not worth fighting for. You are giving up on me so easy, i really just wish you loved me too. I wish only the best for you, even if that means I'm not the one. I'm really going to miss you, more then you will ever know.

Hottie in White BMW Coupe - 85 and Camden - Thurs night - m4w

This is a total longshot - we were stopped at a stop light at the intersection of the 85 South off ramp and Camden in San Jose on Thurs night around 6:45pm.  You were driving a white BMW 3 series coupe, and I was in a black Land Rover SUV.  We exchanged several glances.  If you happen to see this I would enjoy hearing from you.

I think about you almost daily. Maybe we will meet again and live out what we started.

you sold me poppers at L'Amour - m4w

I came in around 4 today and you were working behind the counter.  I thought you were cute but didn't even ask your name; your eyes and smile had my mind going blank.  I was the guy wearing a grey baseball cap with the messy muttonchops/beard (a bit unkempt, lol).  Thought I felt something.  If I'm right, and you see this, hit me up.  I'll be back to talk to you more regardless though; just figured I'd go ahead and tell you that I'm interested ;)

I came in around 4 today and you were working behind the counter.  I thought you were cute but didn't even ask your name; your eyes and smile had my mind going blank.  I was the guy wearing a grey baseball cap with the messy muttonchops/beard (a bit unkempt, lol).  Thought I felt something.  If I'm right, and you see this, hit me up.  I'll be back to talk to you more regardless though; just figured I'd go ahead and tell you that I'm interested ;)    


Olivers stony pt thursday night - m4w

Vista Point Show-Off - m4m

This afternoon, you in your car (4-door sedan) and me on the rock wall. Let me know what kind of car you were driving, so I know it's you. Also, I'd be interested to know if you'd be interested in getting together with me and my partner for some fun.    


Moreen at Fish n Chips 10/13 - m4w

gorgeous older woman at tower mart. who lives in the gated houses - m4w

I was the younger man with the long hair and mustache. You are absolute beauty to me. Completely gorgeous and sexy. There is nothing I wouldn't do for just one rendezvous with you. To lick and kiss that gorgeous body of yours. To feel all of your majesty with my own two hands instead of just my eyes.... you told me you lived in the gated hiuses off willow pass where it turns into 10th street. if you think this could be you just respond with your picture or phone number. Just respond    


I saw you somewhere, I swear - w4mm

I saw you group of men somewhere.  I gazed at you from afar somewhere near this bagel place. You were all walking like military men. My favorite color is purple. I like to give purple nurples. Wondering if I'm ever going to see you. I like brown eyes and town houses. I like to shoot off the hip. I like old westerns. Just looking for a fun, nice group of men. I'm going to pummel you like a little kid on Halloween, you group of men. You better be ready, group of men. I'm rough and rowdy. I'll read your tea leaves, I'm pretty good at that. Sit down and listen children. Sometimes you act like children, group of men. Is this an orgy or something. Sometimes, we can go eat a squid. Go get a job to make some taffy. Shake that laffy taffy. My humps my humps, group of men. My lovely little lumps. Just hit me up for a good time.

I am an attractive Swedish tall white male Blue eyes looking for a long-term lover. Someone I can connect with intellectually, emotionally, and have great chemistry with.

HI


The woman who I never held the door open for. - m4w

Earlier today I had passed through the Landmark building. I saw you walking near me by the Salesforce lobby. You were at one side of the large hallway while I was at the other. Anyways, as I left through the one lobby door, I didn't think to even hold the door open since you were apparently going for the other door.


Woman in Black Dress At Embarcadero Going to Wallnut Creek - m4w

We waited for the Bart together at Embarcadero and I asked you where to switch to go to Berkeley.  You were very kind and told me you had missed all your connections today since you had to go to Palo Alto and lived in Walnut Creek.


You looked handsome this morning - w4m

You came late as usual wearing all black. Clean shaved. I could smell you across the room. We made the briefest eye contact we'd ever made during our time together. Awkward as it was to be standing up there with you with all those eyes staring,... 


School Yard - m4w

We tend to meet eyes than you look away and smile. That smile does attract me more towards you however i do admire your beauty, i just want to strike a conversation but am way to shy to say hello. Even though we both might be in a relationship, i still am attratict to you. 


MexiMelt

ssssssssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hush your mouth 


To M - w4m

After a long hard month of not speaking I finally called you last week. It went how I expected it to go. I lied when I told you I was okay, that I only called because I felt badly about how we left things. I did feel bad but I didn't get your texts and you never called. That wasn't easy I remembered how when I first gave you my number you waited all of 15 minutes to call me. Weeks later and its come to this. When you sent me the pictures of the texts I never received I felt silly for all the time we wasted not talking. But it is what it is and like you said for the best. Prior to the no contact between us you were already gone. That's fine I have a full life and awesome friends I thought about you from time to time when I allowed myself to, most times when I would I would get super sad so I just tried to forget  you. The day we stopped talking I was in what I thought was a minor car accident. Me and my friend were t boned I had to be cut out of my seat belt but felt very lucky that besides being sore and slightly bruised the only thing that really seemed shot were my nerves. I went along with my life as usual went to concerts that week even and at the end of that week could literally not stand up out of bed my back was so whacked. I had to call a friend to help me because I live alone and didn't know if I should call an ambulance. With his help and the neighbors I went to the doctor they realigned my back and made other appointments for a cat scan and etc for the following weeks to come. I started feeling sicker as time went on I won't go too into those details but when I went to my personal doctor last Monday I found out that some of the symptoms I thought were from the whiplash were actually me having a miscarriage. That's why I missed work last Monday and Tuesday. I went against my mother and sisters advice and called you last Tuesday but I didn't mention any of it. I have not been with anyone since you. I knew before I reached out that, that information was irrelevant it wouldn't change anything between us. I won't tell you I was never given the chance to anyway although we left off our 20 min phone conversation on a semi good note I don't trust that if I told you, you wouldn't blame it on me and make me feel even worse. I didn't want pity either but I knew you wouldn't care and although I expect that from you I can't handle witnessing it. So I guess its for the best you haven't given me the time of day. We made something together and on my end it was out of love and I couldn't see myself not being at least friends. My back is still kind of jacked but the pain killers work for the most part and I've been surrounding myself with my good friends I have small weird moments where I feel super super down but otherwise I know its all for the best and I will get through it. For what its worth I really enjoyed our time together when we had time. You meant so much to me.

we said hi as I was going down the Bonham steps  - m4m

I was coming down the Bonham Steps almost to Grand; you had just turned to go up the steps and we said hi.  We both turned around to see if the other was looking...and we were.  Wishing now I would have turned around and gone to talk to you.

embarcadero YMCA - m4w

You turned and smiled at me twice as though you recognized me as I walked through the door. At first I wasn't sure if you were even directing the smile at me. Sorry I didn't recognize you. Have we met?

~*~*One of the Reasons it is So Hard to Let Go*~*~ - m4w

I realized this morning as I played events of the last 3 months through my head while showering that I knew why I was so stuck. Well one main reason anyway. Its because we never got another moment on the backside of that damn chip. I remember before the chip and after the chip was found but not after it was no longer an issue for us. What you did effectively ended the issue and I think I feel a bit robbed that you weren't willing to stick it out past that to see if we snapped back. I think we would have and you could have done the same thing without all of the stress by say just telling me it was gone, but water under the bridge. I felt cheated. That cursed thing was gone but then so were you. Even as I write that last sentence I feel this weight descend on me. Come by, let me say goodbye if that is what it is to be after the chip has gone.... I have included a picture of lunch should you make it in time. Of course the ravioli is handmade as is the sauce with tomatoes and basil from the garden.

**~I Don't Want to Miss You, I Don't Want to Wake w/o You**~~ - m4w

I don't want to miss you anymore. It is not fading it is doing the exact opposite. It hurts more it is harder to go through the motions knowing you are out there somewhere. This shouldn't surprise me...my desire grew everyday without no sign of stopping. I will get you from where ever you are. Please know that I have had numerous contacts that have tried to convince me they are you and the first few really got me going. It has been extremely painful. We can fix this. There are so many reasons to. XXOXOXOXO    


Sarah P. - m4w

We had what turned out to be a fling a few years back.  We both intended for more, but we rushed things and got crushed.  I didn't think my heart was exposed to the excruciating pain I still feel from you today.  I made clear about my past and the one way to truly break my heart.  I still feel intense pain, because you knew of my abandonment issues, yet you abandoned me at a devastating time in my life--a time when my poor health was not only reaffirmed, but also quantified; a time when I needed a partner.  I hadn't just been romantically abandoned in the past, but more recently, in the years prior, I'd been abandoned by countless friends after my health mysteriously started going south.  You knew all this, so I least expected you to follow them!  You later told me you'd pushed others away, too...so, I struggle to understand why you carelessly dated me knowing I have abandonment issues.  We had a lot in common, and connected on many levels.  We should have just remained friends, where the emotional and physical attributes weren't at play.  I believe there was/ (dare I say: is??) a potential for more, but in retrospect, it wasn't a good time in our lives to pursue more.


Wendy's on Wolfe - m4m

You served me from start to finish- short Asian. I'm a SWM, about your height and slightly heavier. I asked for a soft drink refill. You are very cute and I would like to invite you to my place for a suck and fuck (covered). I'm versatile.    


Still Falling for You - w4m

My handsome dream.


Without A Cause - m4w

After all this time the one last thing I can do is give you a clean and simple goodbye. Just know it's not easy. Never has been. Tried to show you loyalty to the extreme. Given you more chances than anyone has ever gotten. You must know there is something about you that kept me around. Something that is missing from most people. You are very easy to love. My heart will always belong to you. No matter what. Given the circumstances, it's just better this way, maybe in the future we'll meet again. You've been a muse. You've done more for me than you could possibly imagine. Just wish it was easier. Maybe at the right time. I haven't given up on you. It's easy for a man to stand by your side. It's a colder world without you in it. I'm going to miss you... all the love in the world...forever. 


I have a very simple fantasy. Can you help? $rewards$ awaits. No sex - m4w

Just after eight o'clock, I saw you and was immediately drawn to you. I raced to make it to the elevator with you. I bet you noticed. I tried to walk as fast as I could without scaring you, and present myself as a sane, gentle man.

Cubs fan at Game 4 - m4w

We were pretty much the only Cubs fans on the third base (left field) side of the lower level.  You were really cute, I was with work friends.  Think you may have been as big a fan as I am.  Wanted to talk to you but wasn't sure if you were with your boyfriend.  If not... let's watch game 1 together!    


the time we spent together - m4w

I know we had something between us but the damn drugs we did took away from the real people we are. I know you can be a thoughtful and less selfish person. my effort to score dope for you was wasted nrg. my biggest pet peeve was not joining me when I asked if you wanted to come with when I walked your dog. I guess we had diffrent motives. you were never my gf so don't consider me another ex. ultimately I am happy for you and happier for me moving on. I hope you treat the next dude better than you did me. couldn't be worse I imagine.    


You paid for my meal at taco bell - m4w

Just wanted to say thank you any way I can:)


beautiful - w4w

I barely remember what you had on. I was mesmerized. YOU: Tall, soft stud. African-American.  Fair, full lips, about your business. Tall, strong and handsomely beautiful. I think you were wearing all cream. You  walked down the hill and crossed the street of 82nd Avenue and McArthur. Your thick, light brown, curly natural hair blowing in the wind. You looked so self-assured. You covered the ground with such confidence. I couldn't move. You walked past me and went into Jim's corner store.  I was standing outside. You were in for a few moments before coming out. When you walked out, I turned my head to the right, smiled and warmly said "hello".  You shyly smiled back in your boi-ish way and acknowledged my greeting. I didn't really hear you. Your smile was so beautiful. You continued on your way. I wish I had stopped you to talk. I wonder if you will ever see this.    


Blonde at Lemonade - m4w

Know Your Enemy, Fight For Your Love - m4w

I desperatly miss my beloved who was manipulated by one and then seduced and whatever else. . .  Only "God" knows the truth.?  Or does he??  I still lover her, I do not blame her, but the person who "targeted" her.  Yes, she was stalked and then "targeted" by a malicious individual.  I forgive my beloved and I would and will fight for her, our relationship and my family.  But you need to know your enemy.  I wanted to meet him, he went into hiding, I was available to meet and talk, he failed to even walk down a simple hallway, he instead hid in his hotel room.  How can I fight for my relationship if your enemy runs and sticks his head in the sand!?  I wanted to speak with him, understand his intentions and look into HIS eyes, and survey them for truth and sincerity or perhaps, deceit and ill wishes.  From what a little birdie told me, his intentions we're not all that pure.  How can they be pure, when he swoops in and seduces your wife who is already emotionally "taxed" and uses coercion as a tactic to "insist" that she make "certain" decisions!  Still, I do not seek "ill will" on this person, THE God will have the last laugh.  I do seek my wife and family back though.  I do find this difficult.  There is no clear direction, no clear method, no clear line to be drawn, it has all become a fog of war.  Additionally, my logistical supply is down to my parents gas car and a 100 dollar bill.  I have late payments and other payments from an "educational" expense that went awary- but that is another story. . .  I must wait and hope that she understands that I have and am making decisions that can and will bring us back together.  I have stiffled her in her career choices, so now I am embracing her desires and medical needs and hoping that she will notice that I'm doing it for her.  My guide is my seperated beautiful- my cuddle bunny, my lover, and my better half, you are my North Star, "wherever" "you" are.  I hope that this message will find you somehow.  To my "Beautiful" I do not want you to be ashamed, I truly do not blame you.  I forgive you and I love you.  Isn't real love supposed to forget and forgive?  Isn't real love supposed to be a source of healing and not just hurt.  I only want you to hurt when you are away from me, but never hurt when you are with me.  I want to support you and give you what you know that you desire and be true to yourself and true to me.  I am your Scorpio and you are my Pisces.  Our meeting was not just by chance, our beliefs are not of this world and are true.  I am fearless, but not hatefull or full of vengeance.  I can look my "enemy" in the face and understand their purpose in my life- but my "intentions" are "pure".  Is it ok to be incredible upset?  I think that I have handled myself pretty well- considering.  I am not saying that I'm perfect or that every decision has been "right" on target.  But,  based upon my limited knowledge and understanding, I am doing what I can do.  Love Never Fails.

Spa Flashback to Thursday September 29th - m4m

it was like a huge gift from the hairy hung muscle daddy gods when you walked into the spa 2 weeks ago. I think you arrived just after 6 pm in all your muscular naked splendor. you look a lot like Peter Hermann, only with slightly more grey hair and much more attractive and distinguished in my opinion. you are by far the sexiest man I have ever seen in that place. I really hope you are a local because I need a repeat with you soon, either back at the same location or one on one someplace more private. tell me where we were at in the spa and what you had me do to you when you finally blasted your load so I know you're the one I'm seeking.

That you were a real friend. A real friend is honest and can say, 'hey, I can't help you.' A fake friend ignores the request.

I cooked and got you salad and fruit in case you can't, or don't want to, eat what I made. I'm not trying to be unkind or mean in any way, I'm just explaining. What I'm doing.I love you and I miss you, and most important of all, I DO NOT CARE WHETHER THE BABY IS MINE OR NOT, I WILL LOVE AND PROVIDE AND PROTECT TIL MY DYING DAY. PLEASE HAVE FAITH, I CAN DO THIS. I'm going out to make some money tonight if I don't hear from u by ten thirty, so I can pay my debts. I'm sorry I didn't get to laundry today that will be first thing tomorrow after appointments.

Handsome Black Man on the BART Train - w4m

Bart Dublin/Pleasanton line train leaving Embarcadero at 5:40 pm today. Our eyes met while we were waiting for the train. 


Cantor Museum Stanford Thursday/June/3 - m4w

I volunteered to take a photo of you with one of the paintings. You told me hat you had to choose one of them for a class and we walked over to the one you chose and I took the photo of you with the painting. Then we walked over to the Native American gallery and kept talking for a couple of minutes. You seemed to like the huge painting and I told you it was made in 2013. Then you said something else and then "thank you" and you went to look at that painting.


Browsing in City Lights - m4w

We were browsing the new releases in City Lights today and you looked so beautiful with your gray sweater and jeans and flats and what looked like a reddish hue in your hair.  Sigh.    


Smiling at each other... - m4m

Walked out of 1345 Grove st apt and saw you sitting on the step in shorts. We made eye contact and smiled a few times.  This was around 5 pm. I think there was a connection. You were so attractive I had to drive by in my car.


24 Hour Fitness on Market Street Shower - m4m

We cruised each other in the shower 5:30 - 6pm this evening.  You're tall with wavy hair, I'm a short Asian man. Hopefully you see this.    


Ramen , New York Filipino Gal - m4w

So you were a exceptionally cute and sexy gal . Across from us at the table. Like jaw dropping. Funny that I was in New York and the cutest gal was from the Bay .  You probably wont see this but My time will be in alameda some time soon. Dragon Rouge or some mexican joint. Alameda is small. Until we meet again.    


Miss you too - m4w

Maybe you will see this. Maybe not. Maybe you were on my town's CL. Maybe you weren't. But I thought of you. I thought of just how much I wanted to be with you and it made me literally cry (and you know how I don't throw that word or those emotions around; I'm in tears as I type). I thought about how much you meant to me and how I probably didn't show it. I think I failed to appreciate you. But love's a learning process. Nobody's got it figured out. You made me feel complete and I failed to appreciate that fully til it was too late. Until we meet again?    


San Ramon Liquor and Gas...next to the Brass Door - m4w

My goodness you are so attractive, gorgeous smile on the gorgeous asian woman that is at the front counter. I've already told you how beautiful your smile is, today you were cold...hands down, next time I walk in, we need to get to know each other more and move forward. Thanks for the smiles, want to see more of them.    


Im out




Lost in translation - a sweet affair - m4w

We both married our college sweethearts, and still have an abundance of love for them. But as we grew in our 20s, we focused on our careers and became different. We definitely don't want to break that comfort in our lives, but the excitement of discovering someone new is... addictive.

okay, you caught me - m4w

You caught me admiring you as we passed on the sidewalk this week - and now I can't get you out of my mind. You gave me half a smile, so I don't think you minded too much. You, shorter, maybe 5'5"?, dark brown hair, pretty eyes, larger than usual breasts. Tell me where we were in so I'll know it's you. Please don't be shy!    


A Pack of Extremely Wild Teenagers! - w4m

We were at the toll booth on the bay bridge. You were in a suped-up convertible behind me, shooting me with a water gun. at one point you swerved off the road and were on two-wheels! You followed me all the way into the city, then turned around and went home! I'd like to see you again :-)


Serious tension - m4w

You're in Ross.  I'm in San Anselmo.  We were in SF.  That should be all you need to know who "we" are.  There was incredible tension in the air today in the office.  I know it was mutual.  And I know the situation prevented us from acting on it.  But I wanted to.  Badly.  And that top you were wearing only made it worse, because it would have made it so easy.  If you see this, it means you're looking for me too.  And I guess it means we should find a way to relieve that tension.    


Beautiful black woman... You work at Safeway - m4w

Brown Hair WM GoodVibes on Lakeshore - m4w

We were at good vibrations, at the same time in Oakland, on Lakeshore today Wed. between 2:15-2:30.  We were both looking at the anal toys at the same time.  I was in front of you in line. Clean cut.  Groomed facial hair. black hair.  black jacket With RayBans. I so wanted to ask you out that I was waiting out front for you until I realized I was about to get a ticket.  so I ran down lakeshore  and missed my opportunity.  By some miracle if you find this send me a message. I would love to take you out and get to know you.

kabuki - m4m

Can someone just explain the scene a Kabuki to me?  I went there a few weeks ago.  Lot's of eye contact and guys showing off.  It was enjoyable, but to what end?  There doesn't seem to be a place for anything more to happen. Do guys meet up afterward?  Or is there something going on there that I'm missing.

Cute girl passing me up since car traffic was pretty molasses, but I didn't mind as I had more time to check you out and smile at each other as we seemed stuck on the same route for awhile before I had to make my turn. Think you were Indian or East Asian definitely is first guess....hope this finds you or else we meet in the bike lane.

Babe at open-house this weekend. - w4m

We both talked for some time about how the two of us were totally looking for better residences.  Ur nickname was Terry, and you sought extra space for ur chihuahua to run around, and my friends call me Christinia, the chic who's on fuck.exchange that was searching for a swimming pool in the backyard.  Look for me if you really want to get together somewhere more private, like my house!

You share same name as my son

We've crossed paths a couple of times at TJ's getting samples in the back of the store. You smiled and joked with my son who made a funny face after eating on of many weird TJ concoctions. You heard me call him by his name and said it was also your name and how men with that name are destined to be great. You and your namesake (lol) bantered a little longer and I was watching with a stupid perma-grin, so impressed with how good you were with kids. Your gruff exterior belie the gentle giant within. Would love to know you ... 


Dancing in your car on 101 - m4w

You were dancing in your car, I pulled up next to you. We waved to each other, I slipped you my number, was hoping for a text. I would love to take you out. I hope to hear from you!

The older guy in the restroom at terminal 1 - m4m

This is a very long shot I never do this but you are sooo gorgeous I wanted to take my chance to see if you check this site. I think you arrived at sfo that day (Wednesday12) morning you were carrying a carry on and a suit bag I was working at SFO passed you by and as I did I looked back and so did you, about and hour later I saw you by the cofffee shop I went to the restroom hopping you would too and you did you were too shy to say anything but I know you were interested as we walked outside the restroom I was gonna approach you to give you my number but something happened tell me what that was so I know it was you or tell me what was I wearing? You are so gorgeous!! I hope you see this!!    


Everyone read this - mw4mw

We need to start writing the names of who we are addressing in these cryptic posts. Who is D? Is D for David? Who is J is J for Jenn? Who is T is T for Tammy? Who is A, is A for Aaron? Is N for Natalie? One initial isn't enough there are 7 million people in the Bay alone who can share that one initial. I rather see "D.V.C." or "Dave" then a measly "D". Narrow it down people. If you want your message to reach your intended then address them by their first name or full name initials.


Looking for Larry - m4m

Back in 1996, a cute white guy in his 30s who cums over to my house during the night hours and sucks me off good, he's about six one, medium build, he likes Asian guys, his name is Larry.  He works during the nights hours and is able to slip away in the middle of the night, he drives a white Mitsubishi Eclipse, lives in the east bay. We met on mega-phone back then.

Woman at Occu Therapy at Walk and Roll dog fest Cupertino - m4w

This past Saturday I saw the most jaw droppingly gorgeous woman working at the Occupational Therapy booth at the "Walk And Roll" Dog Festival at Cupertino's Memorial Park. She was a short brunette wearing sunglasses and had the most amazing smile I've ever seen. I couldn't help but stare! Wanted to say hello but I didn't wanna bother her at work. I'm not the type of guy who falls easily but I haven't been able to stop thinking about her. It's pretty lame I'm posting this but whatevs, ;) if anyone knows who she is tell her she's my dream girl...    


SpiderGwen and Greek gods - m4w

We met on an uber Pool and sat right in. My friend and I were arguing over Athena before I got to say hello. You had a Northern Carolinian accent and red hair. Freckles and a septum in your nose. I never got your name when you left. After that 15 minute ride, I was smitten and wished I called after somehow. If you remember me, tell me what you put in your burgers.

Mariel.... - m4w

Hi I drove u from the park central to the W last night......would love to hook up if ur avail today    


I was the one worth leaving. - w4m

I'm trying to put together a puzzle with missing pieces. I'm trying to figure out where it went wrong and why it was so easy for you to walk away. I keep replaying our relationship in my head and you never seemed unhappy. In fact, you always acted quite the opposite. You were so sure about us, even when I wasn't. You made me feel like I had nothing to worry about. You blindsided me. Why don't you want to fight for us? Why wasn't our relationship worth it you?

Open relationship? ,  scorpion !

I wish all of this was different,


Kali, How Can I Contact You? - m4w

Kali (sp?), wish I knew how to reach you. You're in my thoughts. A lot. You are a golden haired beauty, maybe in your forties, with the most alluring blue eyes and shy smile. You went to Rancho Cotate in the mid-eighties. I had seen you a couple times during that harrowing period of losing our dear friend. It was never an appropriate occasion to say what you do to me, but the haunting has been a persistent, sweet longing. I can still see you switching off your sandals in exchange for your walking shoes at the Sonoma High track, your beautiful daughter in a zig-zagging tow. As we are getting older my recollections come with the stern warning of how short life can be. Win or lose, I hope one day to have that opportunity to pull the curtain back on these compelling emotions. I suppose this is a message in a bottle. The currents have aroused many a man's fates. And now mine among them...

Starbucks on King St - m4w

You work there and you're one of the more friendly/smiley ones there. And you're cute.  Today (Wednesday) you were wearing a different shirt than the black one your normally wear. You looked even better in it. 


Wanting to meet Portsmouth Square Dance Club dancer - m4w

You are one of the better dancers in the Portsmouth Square Dance Club. I am the old man with beard and sandals who comes to watch you rehearse nearly every Saturday. You are tall, thin, graceful and younger than most of the other women. Sometimes you smile at my attentions. You know who you are. I would like to meet you and discreetly talk to you over coffee, tea, or noodles or something any time or place you choose.  Arthur    


I'll admit, I had to piece it together - m4ww

She never shared much with me because she's not an attention whore.  She seemed more interested in hearing me talk, which was a change because I'm not bad looking and most women fall all over themselves trying to impress me.  I've gone on some CL dates and some tinder dates and I have yet to make a connection like the one I had with her.  When I finally opened up to her to tell her I had strong feelings for her and wanted to try for a relationship and go to the next level, the surprised look on her face was something I will never forget.  She was seeing someone and told me she was very sorry if she led me on but she wanted to see where things would go with him.  I found out yesterday they're engaged.


Adriana and Pieter: Your grandpa loves you. - m4mw

Adriana and Pieter, your grandfather in San Francisco loves you. I would be very happy if you would contact me.

I miss you Mamas! There is not a day that I do not think about you. How life would be with us together. I found true love in you, and it sucks that I cant express it to you everyday. You are always in my heart <3    


Castor gym shower - m4m

Showered with you at 8:20 this morning at Castro SF Fitness. You changed into your construction worker clothes after and had a wedding ring on. Both have mustaches. Both smiled at each other.


Mel if your here....... - m4w
Looking to Date... - m4w

I was trying to find a lady to have late night dinners, long scenic drives, movie nights, long walks under the moon light along the beach. But then you deleted your profile on the forbossesonly site. What happened we where online chatting exchanging pics then you went away? I know that this site has lots of woman looking for guys to date but I was only interested in your profile. If you decide to go back on to for bosses only please come say hi. I was the guy with the blue eyes. You know who I am. I'll be waiting.    


False Reality - m4w

You've said that you regret not walking me through the situation, but really, I think you need the walking through: I have every right to be angry that you shared coitus with me one morning, then turned your shoulder to my health and abandoned me the same evening--that's a pain that has deeply scarred me, and one I truly thought you'd address in time. But, I'm loosing hope; should I just let go, or is it a goal of yours to summon the courage? We're talking about a person's health here, not a character flaw, chemistry issue, or fight over hotels--a physiological issue which is widely recognized by the medical community as a disability. Yes, I was eligible for disability at the ripe age of 26, the same age you turned while we were dating. Now, I'm sorry the sex wasn't great, but the last time I'd cum in a woman was after my best friend died and before I was abandoned in that situation. The worst part is you knew this, yet abandoned me, too! You waltzed into my life long enough to stir up emotions and feelings, then left me the exact way I instructed you not to. It's really hard not to feel it was intentional. It really is! Furthermore, what we both didn't fully understand, was my health additionally had an impact on my sexual function. Looking back, it should be crystal clear I was psychologically, and physically damaged in this department. Maybe your feelings were mixed, but you never gave me the opportunity or respect to understand why. The answer to 'why' includes many logical explanations that should have nothing to do with compatibility. What's more, I questioned things often partly because I sensed your feelings were mixed, but mostly because I was terrified, as you were the first I'd dated since my illness set in, and the first I'd gotten serious with since being abandoned after a multi-year relationship. That's an identified source of tension that is far easier to solve than many other life problems such as: health epidemics, climate change, hunger issues, energy sourcing, quality of life, etc. . . So, why run away and not solve it? I hope you can see that, had we had a civilized face-to-face back then, this all would have been put on the table. I can't argue with your feelings, but I can insist you're informed. Instead, you ran away from me through technology. We met a few times after (because I genuinely thought you wanted to remain in my life), but you never wanted to discuss things, you just wanted to act like nothing ever happened. You may think I'm joking about renting that car, and vanishing from you after your cold shoulder, but I wasn't. I also wasn't sure I wanted to see you again (and going back through our texts, I made that clear!). This is where we differed; the damage was too deep for me to act like nothing happened. I wanted to address the conflict between us, you wanted to continue getting to know me without confronting my tension. If you think you have a right to put someone through what you put me through and just move on as 'friends' (or more simply: have sex with someone in a strings attached arrangement, then treat it like a no strings attached [NSA] arrangement when one party needs support), then we clash on the fundamental level of morals, and in which case, we're absolutely not compatible in any capacity. You also say you weren't listening or processing back then, yet today, when I reiterate, your actions don't change one bit! Which hurts even further. Best case scenario is there in fact was a misunderstanding or miscommunication, but again, your actions haven't changed, so there is no evidence to support this! I truly wish this was the case!! You know ignoring me drives me crazy and justifies your decision to cut me off. But, honestly, do you have a better, more mutually beneficial solution other than ignoring? I get to live with the regret of my behavior in the aftermath, and you get to live with the regret of leaving me how and when you did, without giving me the chance to truly know me or where I come from. It shocks me that we haven't been able to meet in the middle of our guilt. It really does!


Really handsome guy at Wal-mart in Union City - m4m

I was doing some shopping by myself after work around 9-10. I had one glance in your direction and couldn't get over how attractive you looked. There was another guy shopping with you so I didn't want to make it obvious how much I was into you. I could only hope to connect and see if I caught your eye as well.

Five years and still heartbroken - m4w

It was five years ago today, I made a terrible mistake and left you. I spent the next two destroying any chances of redemption. I know you won't speak to me but I'm lighting a candle anyway. I love you still. I wish I had the Tesseract so I could change things.

I MISS YOU SO MUCH - w4m

My dearest "A", 


You left your things and took my memories - m4w

When you left there was a huge hole in my life. You tried to make me believe this was all my doing but you and I both know that's not true. I have seen how you are when you want something, you work for it and are tenacious. Obviously we weren't something you wanted. But I feel robbed and not for having taken care of almost everything you needed but of my memories of us. You have shown such disrespect to us and you have shit me out so completely that even the good memories cannot be accessed without a great deal of pain. Was this really necessary? You have your friends and family and you know up here I have almost no one. And now it feels that the world is against me because I won't let up on needing to speak to you. I want answers for why you did what you did. If you had been honest and just walked away that would be one thing but you seemingly went out of your way to cause pain and to keep me from knowing anything about what you did. I make excuses for you but I lose my calm when I do hear from you and it is just mean and seems to show no understanding of the part you played. I am treated like the worst when God knows that can't be. If you treated me with kindness you would get nothing else but the same in return. I have tried to lead by example but I get nothing but hate filled messages and texts because you don't want me to hear your voice? II am acting the same as that other relationship because you are treating me in exactly the same way, only worse because I am surrounded by you. What about the end of that other relationship are you hoping to mirror? And if you are not why follow that pattern? It's almost as if you need me to react with hate and vitriol so you can feel ok about what you did. But what you did wasn't ok and neither is when I lash out, but but when I reach my breaking point you say "see there's the real man" instead of, oops I pushed too hard and too far.

Time travel - m4w

Today I was looking at pictures of us. When we were on vacation together. One picture was you making funny faces and eating a burger. I imagined myself stepping into that photo with what I know now and holding you and kissing you so passionately. I can imagine you stepping back a bit and saying "honey what's wrong?" I'd  reply "what's wrong is that someday I will lose you, and there is nothing I can do about it." Again I wish I could just freeze time and relive all the good times we spent together. It felt like an eternity, and I wish it were. I love you

I failed to get her number, and immediately regretted it as we drove away.  It was immediately obvious that she is extremely intelligent and empathetic.  I fell in love with her brain as she was speaking with the driver -- and I enjoyed the conversation we had immensely.

Every time I think about you...I just get crazy. I've tried to distance myself from this utter helplessness and magnetism that I feel toward you. I've tried to rationalize, I've tried to 'block the energy,' I've tried to remain dispassionate every time I look at you...all have failed. 


Looking for my favorite bartiste/sandwich maker - m4w

Hey you


Honestly - w4m

at this point, I'm not sure if I'll ever get through to you. I think the most logical option would be to jump ship.    


Looking for Laura from KOFY TV dance hour - m4w

Laura, you were an contestant on KOFY TV dance hour. Your enthusiasm was radiating through my tv. I developed a massive crush on you in this short hour of seeing you dance to the 80s music and compete with the highest honor. You got screwed out of the musical chairs but still won over my heart. Hope to hear from you.

Our history

We have a weird relationship. One the one hand, we don't really know all of each other's quirks or details that define most intimate relationships such as allergies or favorite color or most fucked up family member. On the other, we feel familiar like an old flannel and when together, there is a deep trust and connection. I feel the most safe in your arms, and despite our undefined relationship, I have this strange notion that if I need your help for anything, you would be there for me. 


Canadian Honker - m4m

You were wearing a Canadian Honker shirt, reading your cellphone and groping your dick through the pockets of your jeans.  I was the guy who was hypnotized and had to cover his bulge with a backpack.  Hit me up if you see this!


Nishiki bike. Well protected - m4w

Met you in the Bart. Quick chat. You had the classic heavy well worn Nishiki 10 speed. Afraid of theft, you wrapped the cable around you. 


Jogging on West Cliff - m4w

Hey... You were wearing pink leggings and jogging with your little white dog. I don't know, you just seemed fascinating to me. I wanted to say hello, but you were gone before I could, and it was getting dark. I'm pretty sure you didn't see me, so this is a long shot, I know.    


I SEEN YOU AT SKIPOLINI'S PIZZA - m4w

Hottie at Active Sports Club in Union Square - m4m

I sat close to you in the steam room today, my locker was right next to you. Was totally checking you out and wish I caught you naked. You wore boots with a grey colored pant and short sleeve fitted buttoned up. If you see this, hit me up. I'd love to have fun with you ;)


Looking for Shelby we met couple years back you were from Brentwood. - m4w

We messed around and never made it a second time. Think you have two kids one for sure. Your Brazilian but can't tell. Hope you read this    


Teller at Bank of America in Fairfield - m4w

Hi, you helped me today when I came in. I was making a deposit into someone else account. And as you were helping me, I could not help myself from thinking how amazing you looked!! You asked a few questions and as simple as they were I had a hard time even answering them. I honestly have to say I was kind of stunned by you. You truly did look amazing today, and on the slim chance that you even would be reading this. I had to post something. Just in case so sort of miracle happened and you are reading this. Anyways, before I sound any worse than I already do with this post. And you remember who I am, and would like to chat or hang out sometime hit me up. Maybe you could put the amount I deposited today in your reply. Hope to hear from you! 


re:  to my 2 J's - m4w

You were so sexy I was in line behind you you were buying a box of wine and we talked just a little I didn't want to annoy you. Hope you see this and we can talk I thought you were really sexy    


the reason I'm pausing... - m4w

I don't know what's yours and what's hers. I'm. Sorry but this is a complex situation. I threw everything in the closet away because it was infested and Mildew growth on it. I apologize for that but you're pregnant, I'm doing what I think I'm supposed to,  but I don't know where to start because I don't know what I can throw out and what I can't. I'm sober except for pot and I'm dialing back on that. Please come home and tell me what to keep and what I can't.    


Monday pm at Safeway Grand Ave. Oakland - w4m

Handsome man, why didn't I introduce myself?  Now I keep thinking about you and hope you see this posting and that you're available.

Bear at 24 Hr Shower Van Ness - m4m

You are the cute wm bear in 24 hour Fitness in Van Ness. I am the 20-something Asian guy that checked you out. You left rather quickly. Hoping to see you again.


Fremont BART Train Jack-off - m4m

I got on the Fremont train in Embarcadero and from the moment I got into the train you were checking me out. You show me that very thick tool you carry even though there were 2 more guys asleep in the train car as well. You blew your load and it was insane huge...you calmly took a roll of Bounty paper towel from your backpack and cleaned yourself. I got off at the BayFair station and you went towards the Hayward/Fremont direction.


Mind control via Nintendo hat - m4w

You caught me off guard, usually I'm the one that says something stupid.  The way you said nevermind was absolutely adorable.    


Guy at Rigatoni's in Castro Valley. - m4m

You walked into the Restaurant Monday evening  to pick up a to go order. We made eye contact several  times.  I was sitting with a ladyfriend by the window.  You had shorts on, bald, sexy as fuck.  Hit me up  Marko.?? I'm in Hayward. . Your hot, my man. .    


Tuesday Afternoon Whole Foods - m4w

To the very attractive and friendly woman who said Hi to me (dark-haired man in jeans) in Whole Foods today, I'd love to hear from you and meet again on purpose sometime. :)


The Pisces half in and half out

You are half in my life, half out. You took my heart, the bait and toyed with it for years..over 15 of them. You have never once let me reel you all the way in to our relationship. We have always been separate, but as of the last few months, we have been realizing the fight is almost over. You just need to be netted and brought up to the boat. I was never going to take your life. I did not have a barb on that hook. I would have cherished the time with you and let you go. But in the final brief moments of you being with me, where I could hold you, your soul, I would have lived a life time.


Jason - m4m

Thanks for the help with the lights yesterday. I owe you coffee...


G.P. i've got the BIGGEST crush on you! - m4w

I don't know what else to say other then that. You're so kind. You're intelligent, funny, witty and so GORGEOUS!. We work together and we are both married and i'm not saying that i would want this to go further if it were an option or in the open but i wish i could tell you. It's one of those things that i wish i could say but it's too risky. I can no doubt see something between us but...... i don't think the feeling is mutual. LOL anyway. Feels good to type it at least. ;)


When the weather got rough, our relationship was out to sea. - m4w

You brought many wheelbarrows of love and hope onto my job site.  We started building a strong foundation reinforced by an assortment of common interests, similarities, and great conversation.  Our slump test indicated it would be long-standing and lasting.


Get ready..... - w4m

I received a phone call today.  It was around noon, lunch time.  A very interesting phone call this turned out to be.


I think so! - m4w

Can you really find something meaningful on this site? Believe it or not my friends and even family have had some good stories, even ones that have lasted. My best friend found his wife this way and they have been happily married for 4 years now. My other friend met a lot of girls who didn't want anything serious but an exclusive fling or casual dating. I myself found a great relationship that lasted for four years before she had to move away. It almost seems like there's always someone on this site who can connect with you in one way or another. You just never know right?


re: re: love dove - w4m

yea, most of it's tomfoolery - game playing, the NY MCs I find equally as entertaining - but for a lonely soul like me and I'm sure other lonely souls, even if they're empty dreams, here are little dreams we can escape to - like thinking of someone calling me their "love dove".


T-Train & Morning Glances - m4w

You: Super cute asian female with long hair & glasses.


re re re ugly "truth"

Lol! Wtf!


Sam, I'm Dying to Finish What We Started - w4m

What happened to you? You had me going on so many levels. And I haven't even gotten to dress up sexy for you yet, so you should really come over and hang out soon ;-)


Dude Stroking It in his Car on Market this Morning - m4m

I passed by you in your car on Market Street this morning.

Thanks again for the ride.  Can I see you again please?


Safeway Monday - m4m

We talked in line about 6 at Safeway San Mateo (by 92 on El Camino). Had nice conversation. 


Bart Ride Lake Merritt - m4m

You got on Lake Merritt and got off at Embarcadero. Tall, gray hair and we were leading against each other.... you were texting... you were supper hot! I got hard! Let me know if you want to meet sometime.    


Vine Vera - m4m

You pulled me in the store and tried to sell me that crap yesterday. Sorry if I was too firm in my objections and questioning of the products. LOL! You're adorable though. You mentioned that you just joined 24 Hour Fitness. Would be cool to meet up again in a different setting. :)    


"re love dove"

I just took a deep dive look at the Chicago craigslist and it's boring. It pales in comparison. I like venture out to other states to read missed connections and California is the best hands down. Specifically, the San Francisco Bay Area. I enjoy the communal interaction. The back and forth. There's reply posts and most posts can be applied to oneself. The posts here are just better reads with drama and intensity, sometimes just pure tomfoolery, but always entertaining. 


I miss seeing you at the restaurant! - m4w

Hello. To the beautiful woman.


3 tall beautiful black women Target Sunday - m4w

There were three of you gorgeous ladies. You guys had taken you mother (from Sac or Stockton) wine tasting. Later came to target to grab a few things. You asked me some questions by the wine area. We laughed and flirted a min. I was so enamoured with the the woman who had the blonde extensions in her braids, olive green top on She was big chested and so sexy with that curvy body - I about died just looking at it! Lol


"love dove" - w4m

I'm from Chicago but I like to read the MCs in SF, one of the posts recently called his intended his "love dove" - I feel I recognize the writer by his writing style (he posts in different cities, he's posted in Chicago I think several times) - anyway love dove is such a such a beautiful endearing thing to call someone - just putting it out there (sigh).    


We Both Turned Around And Met Eyes - m4w
Sept 18th - m4m

Michael you know who you are. I'm lookin forward to seeing you again in. My heart was broken when I saw you hurting. Know you are loved so very much    


RE : Still don't understand - w4m

I was the one  pushed away by you , You had no time for me and started to treat me like shit ( Magical) HA ! It's been a little over a year now since we have contacted each other and i am glad that  you are happy . I always had & will love you till my last breath ... 


re:  Ugly truth - m4ww

You said it so well.  The ones I call the three slimeball pigs were just described in your post.  This is the ugly truth about them.  I've never met them and I never will.  


Giants game 10/10, Lower Box 104 - m4w

You and your friend were sitting a row behind me and my friend. All around us were Cubs fans, whom my friend and I befriended good-naturedly. I thought you were one too, until you took off your green jacket and had a grey Giants shirt on underneath. My friend said he thought you had a British accent.


WE DANCED TO CHRIS ISAAK AT HARDLY STRICTLY - m4w

You told me you and the guy you were with were not together.  Thanks for a most gorgeous and romantic evening. I mistakenly deleted your phone number. Please contact me.


** BLISSFUL Jen ** on E Harmony - m4w

Hi Jen. I loved our chat so I thought to give this a try. Was disappointed to wake and see you were gone.  Tim    


Re: Hi - m4w

First off I don't hate you. We have exchanged some hateful moments sure but I only shut you out because it hurts less. You can understand that because you've done the same to me. I was unaware you had a therapist but I am glad that you are looking for answers. 


Ugly truth

Until you treat everyone with love and compassion,  you will never know true love.  People are not commodities to be used and discarded.  It's a disgrace that someone can


White pants dance fun - m4w

We were dancing at the Motiv last night, was reggae night and it was a blast. Why didn't I ask you to keep in touch??? Why must I always let these rare and magical moments just drift along just the same as they drift into my life? You're a wonderful gal! Once in the 52 weeks of this year have I had such a delightful spirit by me dancing to the reggae at my friend's bar.    


Girl with the penguin tattoo - m4w

It's been over a year but fuck I miss you.  It's not a day that I haven't thought about you even though I live on the other side of the world.  I wish that night lasted forever.  I know it was only one night but you changed my world for the better . When I was at my worst you showed me that there love in this world. I wish I was brave enough to continue emailing you  Guy with the octopus tattoo please visit me in my dreams    


I wonder

I wonder who I feel you sometimes . 


Cutie at Stanford PTS - m4w

Was helped by a really beautiful girl on campus getting some parking passes in the morning. Your smile really stuck with me. I would love to take you out for some coffee :)    


Consume my thoughts - m4w

You consume my thoughts all the time. I have been through so much, but yet I still think about you. I have been through hell and back, and all I want is just one more moment with you. One more chance to look in your eyes and see if I can see the love that I know once was real. That was something I have never felt before, and still haven't. I send flowers anonymously because I want to know I can make you smile. I don't say who I am with the fear that you would hate them. Why can't I move on from you? Why after each failed relationship, my mind goes back to you? Life isn't a fairytale, but fairytales are based on someone's experience, right? Maybe we are the rare people. After seeing the world for what it is, I can't believe this was just a phase, no matter how many years goes by. My friends say to let you go, but if I knew how I would. We were kids...but it was real. I know it was real. I have dreams of making you happy. I know I can. Just please, take one step toward me, and I will carry us the rest of the way.    


TPA school - m4w

Dear the love of my life - m4w

Hello my love. I am writing to the person to whom I thought I knew. The person I knew before things got bad. Do you remember us? Do you remember me putting my cheek to yours and kissing the back of your neck? Do you remember my scent? Do you remember gazing into eachothers eyes and feeling complete? Yes. It's you to who I am writing to. The girl I loved so dearly. I've never loved anyone as much as I loved you. I wish you knew that. I can only look at pictures of us and wonder where that love went. If I could go back and freeze time when we were so happy with eachother I would relive that day forever. Life just doesn't work like that. I've tried to forget you. It almost worked but this is proof that it hasn't. I still smile at the thought of kissing you. And how good we smelt to eachother. It was fate. I don't know why fate put us together just to tear us apart. I reminisce about our first few encounters with eachother and smile at our complete obliviousness. We were going to be great loves. We had no idea. I'm sorry for my mistakes and know that I wasn't perfect. I just hope you see your wrongs too. If you read this. You will probably know it's me. It sounds like me doesn't it? How did we let this happen?  I'm so disappointed in us. Life can be so cruel

You were my Pillow Princess - m4w

A few months ago you answered my ad looking for a pillow princess.  We met up a few times, and it was amazing.  We then lost touch, and I have since lost all your contact info.  I would really like to meet up again!  We were talking about having much more fun next time :)


Are you  sexting - m4w

Looking to text a dirty girl, with a amazing sex drive and lots of new fantasy. Must be at least 18 and have a open mind. Single or not isn't a problem, because I have no interest in meeting you in person. I don't live here so nothing will happen any way. Also I know iif your real or not so don't wast my time if it's spam I'm not buying anything. Text or email is fine send me your number and a pic if you want. Thanks all do the same    


Fit 19 wal Creek Monday 3:30-5 pm - m4m

you were in black shorts and jersey doing stretching or shoulder stretches with bands around a pole by the front entrance when I cam in.  Shortly afterward, I was doing shrugs and you came and used the shoulder fly machine. Thought we had a few moments there, but being DL I didn't say anything. Just curious if there was anything really there. Think you were with a friend or brother (similar physical characteristics) which is why you kept to yourself? would be cool to grab a beer sometime.  Describe what I was wearing and tell me what I was doing when when we met outside by coincidence just as you were driving away.

J - so much deceit in just one letter. - m4w

J,


Still don't understand - w4m

Why we couldn't make it last. Did you ever love me? Did I do something to lose your love or was it ever there? I thought we had something magical and then you just kept ignoring me and pushing me away. I know I was the one who left, but I felt I had no choice.


Hayward Safeway on Sunday evening - m4m

Hi there. I said hello to you while you were waiting for a parking spot. Saw you again inside the store and was hoping you would introduce yourself. Maybe now?

Hello,


Letting go and letting god pt.2 - w4m

if you aren't all those things I said then who are you? Who were you?  Yeah, I take blame for my own actions as well but that didn't give anyone the right to ever put hands on me and you always did!  You always did for whatever wrong thing I did in your eyes.  I'm not perfect, I never was and I'm never going to be.  The same goes for you, but How do you wake up everyday after all that, and act like nothing?  I'm sorry I feel fucked up and you can call me a victim and blah blahblah I don't care, but every time you wheeled me in you were with alterior motives.  Always, yes WE hurt eachother yes I hurt you and I'm sorry im sorry I wasn't the best womyn but I'm still fucked in the head does that give you happiness? I hope so if that's what you were looking for if not no matter what I just need to


If you want me - m4w

You need to let me know. In some way more overtly than a few cryptic posts. I can't do this anymore. Just admit we're soulmates, even if we can't be together. Then, we can move on. 


Smiles on Miramar - m4w

This is a long shot You were walking down Miramar this afternoon towards Safeway while I drove by. You stared at me the entire time and we smiled at eachother. I was driving a small black SUV.

OK Cupid - m4w




Decom girl, you stole my heart (multicolored onesie) - m4w

I was in a shiny, multicolored onesie. You were small, cute, sprightly, and ever-so-sexy in your gold/black tights. You talked fast, almost nervously. I can tell that your brain runs a million miles a minute, just like me. I was more than a little sloppy drunk, but even so it felt electric when you touched my arm. If that ain't chemistry, then I don't know what is.


Surgery center - m4m

You and I were in the surgery center sitting across from each other. I'm the older guy and you are the most handsome guy. We were on our phones most of the time but occasionally we will look at each other. At one point we smiled and you said hello with your eyebrow. We were both waiting. I don't expect much from this. If you happen to see this, please tell me which surgery center or describe your self or myself.  Hope you see this and please reply and we see where it goes.    


Baylands lunchtime walk - w4m

Hi... we passed each other today in the Baylands. Your smile and nod helped motivate me for my run - thank you for that. I wish I had been able to stop to compliment your hat. I finished my run at the same time as you were getting in your blue Prius. I thought you were cute and would like to treat you to drinks or coffee, see how we get along.

You prolly won't see this but I just can't stop thinking about you after that night. Not sure if I'm your type but I know you're bi. Too bad I got drunk and high.

I have no expectations or whatsoever but I just want to see you again.

Psssst.... - w4m

It's getting easier, I've  forced myself to forget the way your hands feel on my body. The way your mouth felt on mine, and the way my body reacted without permission. I'll continue to tell myself I hate you until you stop showing up in my dreams, what you did wasn't what killed us. You lied when you had the chance to come clean and you didn't trust me enough to see if I could handle you at your worst.....I could have. And I would have but you made the wrong choice. Now, they can have you. All the women you'll fuck just to fuck, unfulfilled and empty. I hope you see my face in everyone of them knowing all I wanted to do was love you....handsome    


Everywhere you are that isn't here.

I saw you briefly on Tinder. Your hair was red and skin pale and you looked into the camera like it was an old friend you were putting up with only because of your shared history. I wanted to match with you so badly that I "super liked" you, which in retrospect I now realize was a mistake. There's no better way to scare off a potential romantic interest than by letting them know to what degree you are interested in them, in this case a "super" degree. We never matched. Then I saw you on OKCupid. Those same photos, that same cool brand of indifference in the shot of you wearing the sunglasses with the one lens missing, the single emerald green hoop of your eye somehow finding more definition on its own. Your profile told me you hadn't logged-in in over a year. Over the next few weeks I'd get a glimpse of you on Bumble, Happn, and I think even in a Yelp comment section. I started Christian Mingle and J-Date accounts just in case. I scoured Farmer's Only because by your photos you really seemed to like the outdoors. Nothing. I just can't seem to hack my way through the thick jungle of the internet long enough to reach out before the overgrowth swallows you again. Hopefully you'll see this, and it's possible after all of my searching you'll just look at me the same way you look at the camera, but maybe not.

I have been so verbose these months because I didn't remember because it was done in anger. So I will keep it short, simple.


Blue Dress at the Phoenix during the debate - m4w

You had on a really cute blue dress and some locks that would not stop. I was with two friends, a girl and a guy. Hopefully you remember me as we shared some heavy eye contact. Please inquire.    


Ocean Beach South Sloat dirt lot saturday - m4w

We pretty much came and went at the same time. You were adorable. You walked by my friend and I at the waters edge but at that time I didn't think you were interested. When we were at our cares I'm pretty sure you were checking me out as much as I was checking you. I was on the phone when you left. I believe were driving a black sedan. Holler!    


T4T - w4m

Ironic that you said "How quickly you forget" when we ran into each other Sunday night. I thought the same thing about you the last time we ran into each other. You acted like you didn't even recognize me. Maybe that was because I was with my BF and you were with your GF.

Hello there,


A smile at the park - m4w

You and I brought our kids to the park...


so intense... - w4m

Out of so many, you stood out.  I felt it the first time I looked at your lips, read your words.  Those words still warm me, make me crazy as well as your pictures...I could not delete them.   You are gone now. And even tho it was only a very short time, there was a connection, and you know it. I wish it could have been more.    


Parkside - m4w

To the cute little Asian girl in the parkside bar on Saturday night watching the giants game who as such a sexy voice    


re: I just wanted to stop the pain and talk

You sound like you let your emotions control you and when that happened you did something really stupid.   That stupid move put someone else's life in danger.  So instead of trying to fix the problem you created,  you concocted more lies, engaged in more stupid moves and now you're backed into a corner. 


PT Isabel dog park - m4m

you were a hot red head and stopped to let your dog swim with mine.  I knew you were taken but I cant stop thinking about you naked.  I saw you do a double back before you left, was wondering if you want to meet again.

You were here for your friends wedding. Im irritated at myself for not getting your information. Maybe we might meet on a cruise sometime.    


Enlightenment - w4m

I believe there's a reason for everything.  Regarding us, I have struggled to find it.  Our connection: passionate, visceral, supernatural, oddly matched, and ill timed has always tested that belief though.  Why?!?! would our beautifully precise clockwork universe orchestrate a perfect storm to throw us together, only to blow us apart in the most devastating and irreparable of ways? 


Your to sexy - m4w

Everytime I see you I want to take you to my car and makeout. Makes me feel really young again were I Lust over you. I want to tie you up and pleasure your body with light spankings, nibbles, passionate kisses I'd like to be able to enjoy that sexy body of yours.keep workingout hard, I love it    


Standing outside of Marshals - m4w

Marshals - The energy I felt was beyond anything I've ever felt. Not the feeling of curiosity but a meaningful connection. If this finds you then it was meant to be. What time was it and when I 1st past you outside of Marshals what were you doing?

You had my heart. Why did you throw it away? - m4w

You may never come to realize what you did. What you had. What we could have accomplished together. I gave you everything, why couldn't you do the same? What didn't I give you? It's the same thing but a new guy right? I trusted in you and slowly began to realize that was my biggest fault. Someday you will see. But I wish you had seen sooner. How I loved you    


Since you left nothing bas been right! - m4w

Everyday since I last waved goodbye too you has been fucked up. Watching you leave in your moms Mercedes I somehow knew that was it and I hate being right itsa curse really. Look I know I made some bad dissisions but NONE of those choices I made sbould keep me from my son! I love you CP and I'm sorry I did what i did I can never change what happened if. I could belive me I would because i now know it was the biggest mistake I ever made. I miss you i miss my son more than words can explain. I know you don't care I know you want me too hurt and I just want you too know that no matter what happened or how much you hate me, I Still and will ALWAYS love you! Kiss Andrew on his little head for me and tell him that his daddy misses him and loves him too.    


SAFEWAY/CASTRO VALLEY - m4w

You were standing outside of Safeway waiting for someone to come out late Friday night on Sept 23rd, Then you got into a RED car of some sort I think. Don't want to give too much away but I had on Timberlands and I said Hi... if anybody knows her please let me know, Caucasian, blonde hair I think and had on a red skirt, very beautiful, extremely beautiful...

I'm sorry I can't email you.  I guess I'm a little paranoid.  I don't want to be tracked with my IP address and I'd prefer to be anonymous.


Eric - Decompression - w4m

We met briefly at Decompression. I was wearing white & dancing at the Dancetronauts car. I saw you in the crowd. You tried to come up to talk to me, but I left to grab food. When I came back you and your friends were gone!

I wish I could muster the nerve to ask you out for coffee, C. 


Safeway Mac & cheese - m4m

You were looking at a car in Dogpatch - w4m

I directed you to Indiana Street. We chatted as we walked along - I was wearing a long, tie-dyed dress with a denim jacket.  I was taken with you and haven't stopped thinking about it.  Long shot sent - the universe may or may not answer, but there it is.  I'd love to see you again...

You were buying your groceries in front of me at Safeway with your two kids, one of whom has the same name as I do.  But I didn't get your name.  I'd love to hear from you.    


It's been so long - m4w

But I still spend nights laying restlessly awake in bed thinking about you. 


I fell in love with your touch - m4w

I'm the stranger who came into the massage parlor with his lady friend. We had confusion about a foot massage, and why I had to take off my shirt. Your touch, the pressure, the feel of your hands, your rhythm were all so in sync with me I fell in love. I'd like see you outside of work. Just based on the synergy of our experience, I think we could have fun. I remember what you were wearing. Email me something about what you were wearing, or the place that you work, and I'll do the rest. I know it's a long shot, but if you know someone that's a masseuse tell them about this post, and let's see if this shoe fits.

Waitress at Omelette Express - m4w

Saw a gorgeous waitress at Omelette Express today around 11am.  You weren't waiting my table but we caught eyes a few times as you were walking by.  You are in your 20s, have multiple earrings in each ear, and were wearing nikes!  I was having brunch with family and didn't have the chance to speak to you.  I was wearing glasses, a grey shirt, and eating a fruit salad.  I've never used missed connections before but thought I'd give it a shot, would love to talk to you!

Seen eachother around for years - w4m

For years we had lived blocks apart and seen each other every couple days. I wanted you from day 1 but the timing was never right. Now, more than ever, I can't seem to get you off my mind. I know the chance of you having any interest in me is slim but here goes nothing. You drive a Honda and also a truck. I recently learned your name, so, if you respond I will know it's you.

They've managed to Steal her keys and get into her home and steal her computers, and everything else.  Her boyfriend and I and some other friends can't do anything to help her because it will only make us look like we are attacking them for no reason.  Meanwhile she is hanging on for life.  I'm so angry but I can't do anything to help her.

You're the stunning, tall woman with beautiful shoulder length hair, you wore sandals, a denim skirt, and wore a very colorful blouse that made you're beautiful face radiate.  You carry yourself with such grace - I know that this is a very long shot, but here's to possibilities.

It's been almost a year since I met you that evening. You came in late for our first date, walking in with a single rose , and your shy smile. I was already a little tipsy waiting for you, but suddenly felt butterflies in my stomach. The sound of your voice, your intense gaze, & your lies captivated me. Yes. Your lies. I love you still, since day one. The empty hurt is lingering & here I am alone.

TAKE A CHANCE - w4m

It has been over a month and I can't shake you off, not knowing why you suddenly became over whelmed and walked away. We had discussed what I was going through, needed time for recovery, I had had begun to make improvements with your help and direction, the sessions were too powerful, I had began to ask too many questions, feeling things as I had never experienced before, it was an awakening, that needed to be harnessed by me, for you to guide me as I was coming out of the dark abase, Your encouragement to be in the "NOW", kept me going, Being of the same culture, yet living in a culture such as this for over 30 years makes me forget how I express myself in the culture we were initially raised, felt you'd guide me back to my true self. Yet you gave up so easily.  


Cookie - w4w

Reading these posts just motivated me to find, a beautiful women I met about a month or 2 ago. She said her name was Cookie from Chicago. We met at an orientation for a job and I never seen her again. We shared great convo, cannabis, laughs, and I can think of no one since the day I met her. Don't just post here go for it. Life is not waiting, and neither will I. Good luck... If by chance you know Cookie from the Chi who lives in Oakland...tell her I need her, in my life. #SunnyDayz

I don't know how to get this across to all of you - m4ww

You are not her missed connection. She's not the sentimental type.  You see I was once sentimental about her.  For years I held on to false hope and saw coded messages that were just not there.  If she says you disgust her,  then you disgust her.  Sentimentality makes a person week.  Maybe once she was your friend but once you turn on her then she dismisses you.  She steps over you and walks away.  She did it with me. She called me pathetic and plain and uninteresting and beneath her.  She was pretty cruel,but now years later she and I are at least talking!

Safeway Line in Campbell - m4m

I was behind you in line at check out. I asked you about your beer. You were wearing a dark grey henley, brown pants (same color as mine). You have dark brown hair and the prettiest blue eyes. You made me laugh and I saw you blush. You're handsome and your body made me feel a certain way. I'd love to get to know you. Describe me in your response so i know it's you, if you're out there :)    


I love you so much - m4w

I did meet you while back, we did see each other so often for past few months, every time I was falling deeper and deeper in love with you. I wish you could love me as much, I wish you missed me more than you do. Why love has to hurt so much? Love me baby, love me the way I do. I want you in my life. You probably will never read my message, you probably will never know how much my love hurts. Maybe one day you will realize it, maybe one day you will love me, just hope its not to late. Does not matter, just be happy, that is all I wish for you baby. I will be gone from your life soon, but I just hope you will be happy as you always do. Love you baby, and always will.    


Nobody was watching the band - m4w

Nobody was watching the band!


Nurse at Peninsula Hosp. 9/98? - m4w

I know this is a long shot, but...


Beatiful Woman At Trader Joe's - m4w

I asked you was the hummus you picked up any good and you recommend a few of them. I am a shy type of man and hesitated furthering the conversation, if you see this tell me what you had on to verify its you.    


2 girls on lighthouse field beach - m4w

You and your friend were sunbathing on a beach below the bike path on west cliff. I was there with some friends and went in the water in my pants. You were spectacularly pretty but, of course, you were hounded by other guys (to take their picture before you left). We made some big eyes at each other. Maybe you or your friend will see this :)    


West Portal Station - m4m

You were getting off the L outbound and I was getting on. We smiled at eachother and winked as well.


Mary from Safeway (manager?) - m4w

I see you several times a week since I work near by (walking distance). Today you walked down "my" aisle and we greeted each other with a smile and a simple hello how are you? You were wearing a blue and red flannel and I was wearing business attire red shirt with matching tie and black jacket. Is it just me or do u feel that same chemistry that I do when we see each other? I find you extremely attractive and Something about the look in your eyes that gives me a sudden rush when momentarily "lock"eyes. If this is you what aisle did we see each other? What part of the day? I'm hoping to hear from you to find out if you feel the same.    


Couldn't keep my eyes off you at first friday - t4w

You were wearing a teal/bright turquoise shirt, blonde, short curly hair and watching the jumping show with your bicycle early on in the evening. I don't think you noticed/saw me, but on the offhand chance you, or someone you know happens upon this, I just wanted to say that you have an incredible smile & are absolutely stunning.    


your both beautiful - m4w

I would love to take you both to dinner I saw you both on the 43 both beautiful ladys one wear a nice white blouse and the other a green blouse    


Wishes

A second chance. I wish we could be friends first, then best friends, then the rest would write/right itself out. My hope would be into best friends on fire, the best kind of partnerships are lovers who vibe off of each other on different levels. We are so alike, with of course, some differences but that's okay because it balances us out.

Strong Swimmer in Turquoise Speedo at UCSF Mission Bay - m4m

We split a pool lane this Saturday afternoon at the UCSF Bakar Gym. You were the strong, bearded swimmer wearing a turquoise speedo. I didn't get any overt vibes from you, but you are too handsome not to try a missed connection. Send me a note if you're interested in meeting up.

You were reading and had a bike (W. Oakland BART) - w4w

Uh... last night 10/7 . The train was a little crowded heading from SF to Pittsburgh Bay Point. It was like 1045ish or 11 something, not totally sure. I was with friends and we got off the train at West Oakland. The train stopped super suddenly and the doors didn't open right away. I was standing next to you at this point, I looked over and you smiled at me. I smiled back pretty awkwardly. I thought you were super cute, but i didn't say anything because you are a complete stranger. 


Molly Stones - m4w

We were shopping together and in the checkout line at the end. I was shocked into shyness by your beauty. From head to toe you are one of the most beautiful creatures I've ever laid eyes on. Hope to see you again!

You and your adorable dog - w4m

Today 10/8 at about 12:40pm(ish), I pulled into a parking spot in the Petsmart parking lot on River St, and parked right in front of you.  Your sweet pup was giving you all the hugs and kisses and you had the happiest look on your face!  When I grabbed a shopping cart you were pulling out of your spot.  Your dog's head was out the passenger window and he/she was smiling at me.  I smiled back and you too had a lovely smile :)

You can't stop posting and I can't stop reading. But I must,  I will.  Not because I don't want you, but because I want true love and happiness.  My life is evolving for the better and I want to be alert and ready for when things take off. You're in my heart and I wish for you peace. M    


I have moved on.... - m4w

Have you noticed I have moved on?  You only come around when you need something.  You know what I want and what I need but you just tease me and never deliver......    


To the cunters - m4ww

To the three women.   She doesn't come to missed connections so never has a clue I write about her and still am in love with her.  I want to do something to help her but she said " Not to worry.  I got this."


Well-dressed black man at First Friday - w4m

To the well-dressed black man who stopped me tonight at First Friday, to tell me I "walk like a boss". You observed that I looked like I was in a hurry - and I was. Despite my hurry, I broke stride, took out my headphones, and stopped to chat with you for a moment. It's unfortunate that the real reason you stopped me was to harass me, and make rude comments about how I obviously *am* gentrification.

Hot Cabrillo female from Carmel High - m4w

We were emailing and we were going to get together at my place in Soquel but I think you got scared off and I'm very sorry, I should have just set up a meeting. If you still are around, let's talk and get us both what we need.    


What could have been? - m4w

Are you surgical? Did you really feel that I backed you into a corner? I liked you, and wanted to start something with you. Am I ugly to you? Is it my race? Is it the distance?  Is it cause I am not your type? Tell me, honestly is it because that one dude who was beating up your pussy decided he wanted to go back to his X and you wont ever get over him ? So that means that I was just a........what would you call it?    


Santana Row-Friday night - m4w

Four ladies in a black rangerover suv in the parking garage at Santana row . I was standing by my car on the phone as you were leaving. You looked at me before you got in the back passenger side seat

You drove a wrx - m4w

I saw you driving your wrx. I was in a blue wrx. We were in 880 going South. Saw you and you finger waved. And I made the worse mistake of my life by keep on driving. I tried to changed into your lanes but you were on the slow lane. I want to see you again.    


45 bus - m4w

we smiled when you got off the 45 bus this evening.  you were the short girl with the cute ass and the headphone buds in, grey sweat pants.  i was the tall dude with the big dig.  hmu and we can have some fun    


Ladies at the Lumineers concert - m4w

Not so much a missed connection as a heartfelt thank you to Chelsea and Christine on my left, and Kristen, Katherine and company to my right. The drive from Auburn was so much more worth it than I could ever have expected. Thank you.


Waitress at Denny's - m4w

I came in twice during the Dreamforce conference.   You were my waitress both times.  The first time I was by myself, and I was very captured by you... I cannot explain why.  Something about you just clicked with me.  I didn't say anything that first day because while you were very polite, you kept your demeanor fairly business-like.  I regret not saying something then.


Buckingham Liquors and Okra - m4m

You and I ended up in line at the same time.  You, with a bottle of water which did not meet the $5 minimum for using a debit card.  Me, with two bottles of beer and a bag of groceries from Trader Joe's.  After commenting (with envy) on the store owner's dinner, I half-fantasized about asking you if you wanted to come back to my place to share my frozen broccoli and sour beer.  Alas, I'm not quite smooth enough to pull that kind of thing off, so I headed home, warmed a bit by the owner's smile and yours.  


Jane's Addiction - m4w

We were both smoking looking at our phones before Jane's came on and you struck up a conversation with me. We both live in the same area and when you left I was kicking myself that I didn't ask for your number since you were so cute. Long shot that you will ever see this but someone once told me about this section so I figured nothing ventured...nothing gained


You asked which picture looks like you - m4w

We met Wednesday evening and then again today you asked me which one you liked the most from two different I.ds. I replied whichever is the real one.  You know who this is so hit me up if you really want to make some money instead of these $40-$50 you be coming to meet me for. I'll make it worth it. Tell me where we met and who I do I know you are for real    


Major Eye Contact at Costco - w4w

You work at Costco in Fairfield, and while I see your cute self every time I visit your store, I found myself drawn to you today, Friday,  10/07. We made eye contact a couple of times...very nice.  Not sure of your status, or if you are even interested in women but I would love to chat with you at my next visit in two weeks,  if not before, if you are able to.    


Cute Bartender - w4w

Should of have focused less on the person next to me and more on you. Oh, well. Maybe for the best.


Post office in a black sedan today - m4w

I was driving a black SUV and we waved and smiled at each other. You have blond hair shoulder length and a nice smile. Love to see you again and hope you read this    


Subconsciously watching - m4mm

Not sure what it was but I reached for a shirt out of anger but then turned on the game to find I matched wits with the combination of perspiration and great expectations. 


Immersion fun Friday afternoon - m4m

We had some fun today at Immersion and I mentioned I'd post here so that we could connect. Hit me up with some details....would be cool to stay in touch.

PHD fantasy - w4m

You're a big-ass big shot, probably married, and definitely much older than me.  I was a lowly laborer in your organization, working over the summer, and would not (or at least, should not) have attracted your attention.


TJ Max - m4m

Tall good looking guy in shorts and flip flops today. I followed you in. Too shy to approach you.    


HSB - Crossed paths, felt connection. - w4m

Curly brown haired girl wearing sunglasses. I saw you when we were walking in the crowd to where Pimps of Joytime was playing. We made eye contact and the connection felt so strong, we both smiled. We crossed paths again at the Pimps of Joytime stage and couldn't stop looking at each other. Wanted to say hi, get your name, and learn more about you, but didn't leave in time to catch up to you. Hopefully we meet again.    


Beer isle at Whole Foods on Franklin - m4w

Hello Fort Point beauty, I attempted to flirt with you but your mind was on beer.  Maybe that is the reason why you are still on my mind now.  This was only an hour ago, but I can see your cute face and sexy body in my mind right now.


To the woman who said I had a great smile - m4w

To the young, beautiful woman who said I had a great smile in front of Kaiser in Rohnert Park. Thank you! You made my day... you looked like you were in a hurry, and I was too. But I wish I could have stopped to chat.    


School yard - m4w

I see you every other morning and afternoon while dropping and picking up. I tend to walk on some days and others drive. I know you know and just wanted to say hello and talk some but i do understand we are both taken    


SFO airport about 4:30 am Oct 3rd wearing lung cancer awareness shirt - w4m

Most missed connections are pretty fruitless ordeals, but this one is especially hopeless since I saw you at the airport. You stuck out enough for me to write. You were standing in the TSA/security line opposite of me and we made eye contact a few times. Or you just happened to be looking my way. You were a tall-ish guy, alone, with dark brown/black hair and light skin. You were wearing a navy colored lung cancer awareness shirt. You were carrying two black bags and I think they were both backpacks. Man, I just thought you were so handsome. I couldn't look away. I was with my male friend and I would have worked up the courage to covertly engage you in conversation had he not been around. Your flight probably left at about 5:30 am considering I saw you briefly walking around and then you disappeared. Hope you made it safely to wherever you were going. I hope I see you again someday.    


Buscando la fe - w4m

Mi Luisito,


you posted for me twice - m4w

We originally met at a counter with a crossword and then you wrote when you saw me out to dinner. Yes I still look at these, and yes I hope you are doing well. Did you ever ditch the Weird Science outfit?    


RE: I miss you - m4w

I think of you. I just can't talk to you right now. I miss you. I just can't admit right now. I need you. I just can't show you right now. I love you. I just can't tell you right now.    


28 Muni Bus towards GG bridge. - m4w

We discussed baseball briefly on the bus. I was the tall guy with NY Giants hat and Mets shorts. You were short Asian woman. I shoulda asked you out. Got shy. You got off at Golden Gate Bridge stop. Drinks? Coffee? Lunch?    


Chelsea P. - m4w

I never should have walked away from you. I was young, confused, and scared. I hurt you, and after 6 years I still can't forgive myself. When I was sent away at 16, you were the one person I missed most in that shitty little farming town. Here I am, 27 years old, and I can't seem to let go of what might have been.  I finally had a chance to show you how much I love you, and I blew it. It seems now I have my life together, but that one final piece is missing. I'll never forget you, Chelsea. I'll never forget our naps on the couch after binge watching anime and playing Shadow of the Colossus and Psychonauts. I'll never forget how tight you'd hug me, how softly you'd kiss me, and how wonderful it felt to lay my head in your lap and forget about the world for a moment. You were the one person who never did me wrong. I can't believe I let myself screw things up so badly. You know where to find me if you ever change your mind. I won't disappoint you again.    


Looking for Bulldog - m4m

I'm looking for a guy who used to go by Bulldog (or something with that in the screenname) on a4a. A few years back, my bf at the time set me up and had you come by our place to surprise fuck me. Was so unbelievably hot. Anyway. I saw you on a4a not long after that and never hit you up. Would love to meet up again and have you fill my hole.    


Houndstooth mini skirt at park - m4w

Yesterday, Thursday at aquatic park, you were walking slowly,  that little mini skirt and your white framed shades...


Bay Bridge Flirtation - m4m

You were heading into the City around 6:15 last night in your adorable pumpkin colored Mini.  I was in a white 4Runner.  We made eye contact and smiled several times as we crossed the Bridge before I lost track of you.

To the super hot pool guy heading in to clean the pool while I was leaving from cleaning the house. You aren't my usual type but just wanted to say you were pretty hot.

Anyways if you ever see this, have an awesome day hopefully I'll run into you again :)

I miss you - w4m

Knowing someone isn't coming back, doesn't mean you ever stop waiting. You can decorate absence however you want- but you're still gonna feel what's missing.


Girl in baggy green men's pants on Bart from ashby - m4w

You were wearing a tight black  tshirt and had a shoulder bag. You flipped your dark hair a few times. I didn't think you were looking at me but it was fun to think so anyway. You're skin was so smooth and your wrists so thin. You were beautiful to be near. I use the past tense because you don't exist anymore, but you were a treat.    


Looking for my friend tina - m4w

.


Autotopia Concord - m4m

This is probably a shot in the dark....  Want to keep this discreet so not going to put too much detail in here. I've seen you working there a few times. Saw you Friday morning, you're a good looking Latin guy... we make a lot of eye contact but not sure if you're into guys or not.  If you see this hit me back and let me know what you were wearing or something so I know it's you.  Hope to hear from you.    


Bakery - m4w

I was looking at you and we said good morning as you walked into the Bakery.  I would have said more, but you were with a friend. That was nice, and you made my Friday for sure.    


Speedwalking on Precita this morning - m4w

I was walking with my kids this morning and you were out walking for exercise.  You passed us twice. The first time we held each other's gaze for a short minute. I thought you were adorable. And sexy even in your workout clothes! You're white with brown hair, wearing all black. 


hot tamales - m4m

you two got on bart i believe at west oakland carrying tamales home for dinner. they looked really good, but you two looked even better. i was the cub shy guy right next to both of you with headphones in. it's hard to describe but i felt a strong sexual connection to both of you. tell me what color shirt i was wearing and you can share me, or at the very least please let me watch.
